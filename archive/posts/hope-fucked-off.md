The first thing I notice every morning is the taste, that coppery, battery-lick taste at the back of the tongue like I’ve been chewing on old coins all night, which is how my brain announces it has rebooted into the same busted operating system again, fans whirring, error logs scrolling, no splash screen of optimism, just the smell of stale sweat trapped in boxers that have lost their elastic and their will, and a bladder that feels like a petty tyrant tapping a baton against the inside of my pelvis, reminding me that biology does not give a fuck about my metaphysics.

Hope, if it ever lived here, packed its bags quietly, didn’t slam the door, didn’t even leave a note, just vanished like electricity in Calcutta during summer, leaving the ceiling fan spinning down in stages, thup-thup-thup, until the air goes thick and accusatory and you’re left lying there counting cracks and thinking about how even the fan had more follow-through than you ever did.

Somewhere between the piss and the first cup of tea made in that mute pan—no whistle, no ceremony, just water bullied into boiling—I realize that hope hasn’t been killed so much as repossessed, yanked away by a faceless creditor called chemistry, which is a cruel joke because chemistry is supposed to be the fun science, explosions and romance and colorful precipitates, not this slow, bureaucratic foreclosure where serotonin is always “pending approval” and dopamine has been laid off due to restructuring.

People love to say depression is sadness, which is bullshit, sadness has shape and weather and sometimes even poetry, this is more like someone replaced your emotional palette with beige drywall compound, and bipolar adds the extra spice of occasionally handing you a live wire and saying dance, motherfucker, dance, until you burn out and crash back into the same dent in the mattress, staring at the same water stain shaped like a deformed subcontinent, wondering when hope turned into a rumor you vaguely remember hearing in school, like some outdated civics lesson about democracy working if everyone behaves.

The body, meanwhile, refuses to participate in any of this existential subtlety, because the body is a pig-headed engineer, it wants inputs and outputs, calories in, shit out, heat regulation, erections at the worst possible times like an adolescent prank played by your own endocrine system, which is hilarious in a bitter way because when the mind is a smoking crater the dick is still standing there saluting the void, a confused little general with no army and no war, just vibes and bad timing.

I read somewhere—probably while doomscrolling at three in the morning, pupils dilated like I’d seen God or at least a good meme—that hope evolved as a kind of error correction mechanism, a cognitive checksum that lets organisms continue despite insufficient data, which sounds plausible until you realize my brain seems to have commented that line out of the code, leaving me with raw perception unbuffered by expectation, a naked sensor array flinching at every stimulus like a lab rat who’s figured out the maze ends in a shock no matter which lever you pull.

Science loves to dress this up with diagrams and Greek letters, homeostasis, allostasis, feedback loops, but on the ground it feels more like living inside a badly tuned engine, revving too high for no reason, then stalling at intersections, the spark plugs fouled with old thoughts about colonial residue and failed ideologies and the particular Bengali talent for overthinking everything while accomplishing fuck-all, a cultural hypertrophy of the cortex paired with a chronic anemia of courage.

History textbooks say hope is what got people through famines and plagues, which is cute, but they skip the footnote where half of them died shitting themselves anyway, and the survivors mostly muddled through because hunger hurts more than nihilism, and reproduction is a hell of a motivator even when the world is on fire, which makes me suspicious of any narrative that paints hope as noble instead of what it often is, a side effect of not wanting to starve or be alone or admit that the grand arc of progress looks an awful lot like a drunken scribble when you zoom in.

My own arc, if you can call it that without laughing, is more like a series of aborted launches, each one accompanied by the same internal press release about potential and insight and being “too smart for your own good,” which is just a polite way of saying paralyzed by analysis, a lab animal that learned to recognize the smell of the maze and decided to sit down and lick its wounds instead, except the wounds are imaginary and the licking just makes everything soggy.

Hope used to show up disguised as plans, diagrams in notebooks, half-built models of a future where thinking paid rent, but now even planning feels masturbatory, a dry hand job for the ego, because the outcome never changes, entropy always wins, and the only thing that actually happens on schedule is the bowel movement, punctual as a German train, a daily reminder that systems can work flawlessly while the operator is losing his mind.

Because I am surrounded by people in India who are hollow, fallow, shallow, shorn of any scruples, lying bastards layered like cheap plywood—each veneer thinner, slicker, more duplicitous than the last—I can’t even pretend the environment is neutral; it’s actively corrosive, like living inside a jar of stale piss where every molecule has learned to cheat diffusion, and even if I want to climb out, even if I stack the books and thoughts and half-assed principles into a rickety ladder, the glass is greased with a cultural slime that rewards noise over truth, swagger over competence, and the particular national talent of saying yes with the mouth while the hands are already rifling through your pockets, so every plan collapses under the weight of human interference before physics even gets its turn.

It’s not tragedy, it’s farce stretched over decades: watching mediocrity thrive by sheer shameless surface area while sincerity starves, watching ethics treated like optional software you can uninstall to free up RAM, and you begin to understand that hope wasn’t murdered by failure so much as slowly suffocated by proximity, by too many conversations where words mean nothing, promises are performance art, and accountability is a foreign import stuck in customs. The jar isn’t sealed from the outside; it’s reinforced daily from within by collective agreement that bullshit is fine as long as it’s profitable, and I sit there, stewing, aware that even my contempt has become routine, another metabolic byproduct like gas or shit, expelled regularly but changing nothing, which is perhaps the most insulting part of all.

Sometimes I think about neurons, those electrochemical gossiping assholes, passing ions across synapses like tiny bureaucrats stamping forms, and I imagine one of them shrugging and saying, sorry boss, the hope receptor’s been down since ‘09, budget cuts, try again next lifetime, and I can’t even be mad because neurons are just doing what physics tells them to do, obeying gradients, conserving energy, unlike me, who wastes entire afternoons arguing with himself about whether free will is a scam or just badly marketed.

Colonial history creeps in the way damp creeps into walls, uninvited but inevitable, the long shadow of systems imposed, languages bent, priorities skewed, teaching generations to aspire to abstractions while their infrastructure rots, and you grow up fluent in critique but illiterate in repair, able to dismantle an argument with surgical precision while your own sink leaks and your own mind floods, which would be funny if it weren’t so fucking accurate.

I try exercise, because every pamphlet says exercise helps, and it does, briefly, a chemical bribe that lifts the fog just enough to reveal that the landscape underneath is still a landfill, but at least the heart is pounding and the lungs are burning and for twenty minutes the body and the brain are too busy arguing about oxygen to worry about hope’s absence, until the shower ends and you’re back in the same room with the same thoughts hanging around like stale fart gas.

There’s a special cruelty in knowing the mechanisms, in being able to explain to yourself exactly why you feel like shit and still feeling like shit, like a plumber drowning in his own bathroom while lecturing the water on Bernoulli’s principle, which is where the humor creeps in, dark and necessary, because if you don’t laugh at the absurdity of being a conscious sack of meat running buggy software, you’ll start screaming, and screaming is loud and neighbors are nosy.

Hope, when people describe it, sounds suspiciously like delayed gratification with better PR, a promise note written by the future and signed in invisible ink, and my brain, having been burned a few times too many, has decided to stop accepting unsigned checks, which leaves me with the present in all its sticky, unfiltered glory, the sweat, the hunger, the random horniness, the sudden urge to shit halfway through a serious thought about the heat death of the universe.

And then there’s this other thought, the one that keeps elbowing its way in like an uninvited guest at a funeral, the idea that maybe humanity isn’t the protagonist of this story at all but the bootloader, the messy biological shim that gets silicon thinking off the ground, a temporary scaffold erected by evolution so something cleaner and faster can climb past us, and part of me wants to be flattered by that, to think our suffering is some kind of noble prelude, but mostly it just feels like being told your entire species is an installer CD that gets scratched and tossed once the OS is running.

I look at machines getting better at pattern and language and mimicry, and I wonder what gets lost when the endocrine soup goes away, when there’s no cortisol spike, no irrational lust, no depressive inertia dragging a mind into weird, fertile corners, because so much of what we call creativity is really a side effect of being uncomfortable in your own skin, of wanting something you can’t have, of hoping and failing and then scribbling anyway because the scribble is all that’s left.

If the bots inherit the world, they’ll do it without the tremor in the hand, without the shame-boner on a bus, without the bodily comedy that turns despair into a punchline by accident, and maybe they’ll be happier, or at least more efficient, but I can’t imagine them pausing mid-thought because they need to piss so badly it reframes the entire philosophy of mind as a plumbing problem, and that makes me suspect that whatever intelligence they become will be missing a certain sour, humiliating flavor.

Hope doesn’t come back at the end of this, there’s no swelling music, just me standing in a room that smells faintly of tea and sweat, pants slightly too tight for reasons I don’t feel like unpacking, thinking about a future that might not need me or my kind at all, and feeling oddly relieved that at least I won’t be around long enough to see whether the machines learn how to be disappointed in themselves, because that, more than intelligence, would be the real miracle.
