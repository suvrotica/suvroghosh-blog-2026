The ceiling fan is doing that tired, arthritic wobble again, like it’s trying to remember what “steady” used to mean back when it was young and believed in pensions, and below it my phone—its screen spiderwebbed in three places like a minor Greek tragedy—plays an 8K “foreigner walk” through some European old town where even the air looks lacquered.

There are cobblestones. There are clean shadows. There are bakeries that smell, through the glass and pixels, like butter behaving itself. The camera glides as if the person holding it has never had to step over a puddle that is fifty percent rainwater and fifty percent the municipal government’s indifference. People in the video wear winter coats that seem stitched from optimism. Their streetlights are not so much lights as an ongoing public apology for darkness. My own streetlight outside is an intermittent religious experience: it works when it feels like it, which is also how our bureaucracy approaches basic services.

A scooter screams past in real life—thin, angry, two-stroke nostalgia. A neighbor’s pressure pump coughs. Somewhere, a dog delivers a monologue to the moon in the key of “I have been abandoned by God and also by my owner.” The room smells faintly of phenyl, dust, and yesterday’s oil. I sit under this fan like a man waiting for an exam result he already knows, and I watch a place where even the gutters look like they were designed by a committee of poets.

And then my brain does the thing it always does—this petty, compulsive, bookish vandalism of reality—where it takes the soft human ache and tries to model it.

Not because modeling fixes anything. Because modeling is what you do when you can’t fix anything and you need something to feel like a lever.

## The Low-Dimensional Life

Here is the obscene joke: the “life” I live, this lower middle-class Calcutta organism-life, isn’t rich in the way the brochure says India is rich. It’s rich in the way a drain is rich—rich in content, yes, but not the kind you want to put on a postcard.

If you were a mathematician (or a mildly deranged man with a laptop and too much time, i.e., me), you might say: my world has low intrinsic dimensionality.

That’s a cold phrase for a hot feeling, so let’s drag it down to street level.

Dimensionality, in the everyday sense, is “how many independent directions you can move.” A line gives you one direction. A sheet gives you two. A room gives you three. Add time and you have a physics textbook and a headache.

But data—the kind we pretend our lives become once they’re digitized—has dimensions too. Income, rent, air quality, commute time, sleep hours, calories, blood pressure, school fees, number of power cuts, the price of cooking gas, the number of relatives who can phone you and make you feel guilty in under thirty seconds. Each is a coordinate. Each is an axis. Each is an invisible bar in the cage.

Now: a “high-dimensional space” is what happens when you have many such axes. Modern life, from the viewpoint of the marketing department, is a fireworks show in that space. Infinite choices. Infinite flavors. Infinite brands. Infinite “experiences.” This is the India of startup pitch decks and diaspora nostalgia: “vibrant,” “dynamic,” “young,” “aspirational,” and occasionally “ancient,” like a museum that also sells mutual funds.

But my life—the poor-to-lower-middle sort of life—doesn’t roam that glittering hyperspace. It lives on something more like a narrow alley. A small manifold. A constrained surface inside the big space. You can call it a “subspace” if you like, but “subspace” makes it sound like science fiction; in practice it’s just the grim geometry of limited options.

Most days, I have maybe three real degrees of freedom: how much I spend, how much I endure, and how much I pretend not to notice.

Everything else is decoration. Or delusion.

This is why the 8K foreigner walk stings. That video is not merely sharper; it is higher-dimensional. It has room for whim. For detours. For silent dignity. For public infrastructure that isn’t a punchline. Even the color palette implies spare capacity—like their society has bandwidth left over after paying the bills of survival.

My own visual world in December is a kind of grayscale spiritual test: smoggy light, wet concrete, muffled horns, the sky the color of a used surgical mask. The brochure India is “Technicolor,” the lived India is often “compressed to save space.”

And yes, I notice the irony: I’m watching a compressed video stream while thinking about compression. My life as a metaphor, delivered by algorithm, on a device assembled by people whose own lives likely resemble mine more than the Swiss village I’m streaming.

Everything is connected, and the connections are mostly rude.

## Compression: When the World Becomes a File

Video compression works because most frames are redundant. The background doesn’t change much. The human eye doesn’t mind a little cheating. The codec keeps what matters, discards what doesn’t, and prays you won’t notice. You get to have your butter-scented cobblestones without paying the true cost in data.

Poverty is also a compression scheme—except no one asked you if you were okay with the quality loss.

You lose resolution first. You stop seeing long-term. You stop thinking in decades. You stop planning. You start reacting. Your mind becomes an emergency room. Everything is triage: what must be handled now, what can be postponed, what will metastasize if ignored.

Then you lose color. Not literal color—though sometimes that too—but the color of possibility. The ability to say, “I’ll explore.” The ability to waste time safely. The ability to be inefficient without being punished.

Then you lose dimensions. You become a vector with fewer components: food, rent, health, electricity, family obligations, one or two fragile pleasures you defend like a corner shop defends its last packet of biscuits.

My depressed mind loves this part. Depression is a natural dimensionality reducer. It takes the huge, messy, noisy world and projects it onto one bleak axis: “bad.” It’s a kind of principal component analysis performed by the soul with a blunt instrument.

And then, once in a while, the hypomania arrives like a spark in dry straw, and I see structure instead of swamp. I see that the low-dimensionality isn’t just personal failure; it’s systemic design. It’s constraints written into the environment: the cost of space, the fragility of work, the casual cruelty of institutions, the way a single illness can rotate your entire coordinate system into catastrophe.

Mania is not wisdom. Mania is the feeling that you’re finally smart enough to outrun the trap. Sometimes it’s just the trap wearing your face.

Still—there’s a clarity it brings, like a cold wind that makes the air briefly transparent.

## Hunger and Thirst as the Hidden Variables

There’s an old line in the Aitareya Upanishad that I keep thinking about—not because I’m pious (I’m not; my spirituality is mostly sarcasm), but because ancient texts sometimes say the quiet part out loud with startling bluntness.

It describes the gods—yes, gods, this is India, we do metaphysics with characters—falling into the vast ocean of existence, and then:

> “तमशनापिपासाभ्यामन्ववार्जत्” — “He subjected him to hunger and thirst.”

Hunger (*aśanā*) and thirst (*pipāsā*) show up like debt collectors at the cosmic housewarming party, and the gods themselves have to ask for an “abode” where they can eat.

That is the low-dimensional truth hiding under a thousand high-dimensional fantasies: hunger and thirst are the original latent variables. The world can dress itself in mythology, nationalism, GDP graphs, startup conferences, and the crisp typography of international magazines, but underneath, most human behavior is still powered by the same two engines—feed the body, keep the body from hurting.

In my neighborhood, this isn’t philosophy. It’s the daily operating system.

And what the brochure does—what the 4K walk does, what the influencer does—is it re-embeds India into a different space. It maps us into “culture,” “heritage,” “color,” “spirituality,” “chaos (but make it charming),” and “street food (but cropped to exclude the drain).”

A clever embedding. A profitable embedding. A morally bankrupt embedding.

## Dimensionality Reduction for Beginners (Who Didn’t Ask to Learn It)

Let me do the annoying bookish thing and explain the jargon, because if I don’t, my brain will itch.

When you have data in many dimensions—say, millions of lives, each described by dozens of variables—you often want a simpler picture. You want to compress it without losing what matters.

There are several ways.

One is **PCA: Principal Component Analysis**. Imagine all your data points (people, days, neighborhoods) floating in a big space. PCA finds the directions along which the data varies the most—the main “slopes” of the cloud—and rotates the axes so the first few capture most of the action. It’s like saying: “Forget the tiny quirks; what are the big forces shaping this mess?”

In poverty-land, PCA’s first component might be “how close you are to disaster.” The second might be “how much dignity you can afford.” The third might be “how much time you spend navigating bureaucracy versus living.”

Another is **t-SNE or UMAP**—fancier tools that try to preserve local neighborhoods. They don’t care about global geometry; they care about who resembles whom. They’re like social maps: you might not know where you are in the world, but you know who is stuck near you, and you can’t teleport out of the cluster.

**Autoencoders**—neural networks trained to compress and reconstruct—are the modern, slightly occult version. You feed in your high-dimensional life; the model squeezes it through a narrow “bottleneck” (a latent code), then tries to rebuild the original. The bottleneck is the compact representation. The model learns what features are essential to reconstructing reality.

And here comes the grim punchline: poverty already autoencodes you.

It forces your life through a narrow bottleneck—money, time, health, social safety—and reconstructs you as a smaller person. A person with fewer affordances. A person who cannot express the full dimensionality of their mind because the environment doesn’t supply the degrees of freedom.

The tragedy is not that we’re “low” anything. The tragedy is that we are compressed by constraints, and then judged as if the compression were a personality flaw.

## The Brochure as a Lie in High Resolution

It’s not that the glossy India is false. It’s that it’s a conditional truth: true given money, true given caste (let’s not pretend), true given language, true given access, true given the correct zip code and the correct surname and the correct kind of confidence.

What bothers me is the way the high-dimensional story cannibalizes the low-dimensional one. It uses poverty as texture. It uses struggle as aesthetic. It uses “resilience” as a euphemism for “we’ve decided you can suffer indefinitely.”

Even the foreigner walks do this gently. The camera glides over a bazaar. We hear a flute. We see a cow. We see saffron. We see a temple. We do not see the municipal ledger. We do not see the respiratory clinic. We do not see the kid doing homework under a dying tube light while the adults argue about a loan.

The algorithm knows what sells: color, motion, novelty, “authenticity” with a stabilizer.

My life is authentic too. It just isn’t sponsor-friendly.

## A Brief, Uninvited History of Measurement

The obsession with representing reality compactly isn’t new. Empires have always needed summaries.

The British didn’t rule India with vibes. They ruled with ledgers, maps, censuses, and categories—an early, analog version of feature engineering. You can’t extract revenue from a place you can’t measure. So you measure. You classify. You reduce. You compress millions of messy humans into tables.

Modern states do it too, with more math and better fonts. Poverty lines, indices, quintiles, deciles, “beneficiaries,” “targeting,” “leakage.” The language of care, written in the grammar of control.

Statistics itself—the whole discipline—grew up partly as a way of making populations legible: Gauss smoothing noisy measurements, Quetelet inventing the “average man,” Pearson building correlation, Fisher turning uncertainty into a machine. It’s beautiful, in the way a guillotine is beautiful: elegant, precise, and indifferent to the neck.

And now, in the era of machine learning, we do it at scale. We embed lives into vectors. We represent neighborhoods as latent codes. We predict who will default, who will migrate, who will get sick, who will be “high risk,” who will be “low value.”

Sometimes this helps. Sometimes it saves lives. Sometimes it just makes exploitation more efficient.

The moral question isn’t whether we can compress reality. We can. The moral question is: what do we choose to preserve, and what do we discard as “noise”?

Because if you discard dignity as noise, you end up with a very accurate model of a very cruel world.

## When the Mood Shifts, the Geometry Changes

Depression makes the manifold feel like a coffin. Every axis points inward. Every path loops back to the same place: “nothing changes.” The future collapses to a dot. The past becomes a smear.

In that state, even the 8K video isn’t tempting; it’s insulting. It’s like someone waving a banquet menu at a starving man and asking him to admire the typography.

Then hypomania arrives and my brain starts drawing diagrams in the air. I start thinking: what if the low-dimensional distribution of my life—the narrow corridor of constraints—is not destiny but representation? What if there are hidden variables we could change? What if, with the right intervention, the manifold could unfold, like a crumpled map flattened onto a table?

This is where I become dangerous to myself, because hope in me doesn’t arrive as a gentle candle. It arrives as a flamethrower with a thesis.

I start thinking about levers: health access, clean air, stable electricity, non-predatory credit, dignified work, public transport that doesn’t treat humans as livestock. I start thinking about how small changes in the right coordinate can shift the entire distribution.

And then—because I am me—I also think about how institutions will sabotage this, because institutions are often staffed by humans, and humans are frequently disappointing mammals in formal clothing.

## Ancient Algorithms, Modern Loops

There’s another Sanskrit verse that keeps appearing in commentaries and devotional circles—again, not because I’m joining the choir, but because the structure is interesting. It’s attributed to the Vishnu Purana (and echoed elsewhere), and it says:

> “ध्यायन् कृते यजन् यज्ञैस् त्रेतायां द्वापरेऽर्चयन् ।  
> यद् आप्नोति तद् आप्नोति कलौ सङ्कीर्त्य केशवम् ॥” 

Roughly: what you achieved by meditation in one age, by sacrifice in another, by worship in another—you can achieve in Kali Yuga simply by chanting.

Now, strip away the theology and what’s left is a thought about method under constraint. Different eras, different compute budgets. When the world is noisy and degraded, the “algorithm” becomes simpler, more repetitive, more robust. Less fragile.

It’s weirdly modern. In machine learning, if your environment is messy, you often prefer methods that are stable and cheap: stochastic gradient descent, repeated small updates, lots of iterations. You don’t run a delicate optimization routine on a machine that keeps losing power. You chant your way down the loss landscape.

Kali Yuga, as a metaphor, is the age of unreliable power supply—literal and moral. So the method becomes a loop.

And here is the grim secular mirror: poverty is also a Kali Yuga. It forces you into repetitive algorithms: earn, spend, endure; earn, spend, endure. Your “iterations” are days. Your “learning rate” is exhaustion. Your “loss function” is pain.

People who live in the brochure don’t see this loop because they have enough resources to run more complex programs. They can afford mistakes. They can afford exploration. They can afford to be interesting.

The rest of us are running survival code on hardware that overheats.

## The Compact Representation I Actually Live In

If I had to compress my own distribution—my particular little cloud of days—into a latent vector, it would look insulting in its simplicity.

One coordinate is money, obviously, but money is not just money. Money is time. Money is air quality (because you can buy distance). Money is silence. Money is insulation. Money is the difference between “a headache” and “a diagnosis.”

Another coordinate is institutional friction: how many hours of my life are eaten by forms, queues, “come tomorrow,” “server down,” “sign here,” “bring Xerox,” “need witness,” “wrong counter,” “not my department.” This friction is not an inconvenience; it is a tax on the poor. The rich outsource it. The poor pay it in lifespan.

Another coordinate is social density: how many people share your space, your noise, your privacy. The brochure sells “community.” The lived version is “you will never be alone enough to hear your own thoughts.”

Another coordinate is health, which is always the silent tyrant. A single chronic condition can tilt the entire manifold, turning your already narrow corridor into a crack in the wall you have to squeeze through sideways.

And yes, there are smaller coordinates too: shame, envy, nostalgia, a stubborn refusal to die quietly, the occasional ridiculous joy of a good cup of tea, the way a book can still open a window in a room with no breeze.

But the point is: it’s compact. Brutally compact. A few variables explain a lot.

Which means two things at once, and they fight inside my skull like rival tenants.

One: it suggests leverage. Change a small number of things and you change the whole distribution.

Two: it reveals how little society cares, because those levers are not mysterious. They’re boring. They’re infrastructure. They’re public health. They’re housing. They’re air. They’re fairness in institutions. Things that don’t glitter, so they don’t get built.

## The Strange Usefulness of Seeing It This Way

There’s a temptation to romanticize “the struggle,” to turn low-dimensional living into some kind of spiritual discipline. I refuse. If hardship made people noble, India would be a nation of saints and not a nation of brilliantly adaptive cynics.

Still—seeing the geometry helps me avoid one particular poison: the idea that my constriction is purely personal.

Yes, I have flaws. I procrastinate. I doom-scroll. I self-sabotage. I get bitter. I write drafts and delete them like I’m trying to erase myself in installments. I am complicit in my stagnation, because humans are always complicit in the systems they inhabit; we cooperate just to survive.

But I am also living inside constraints that are engineered, maintained, and justified by people who benefit from them.

The brochure says: “Look at our growth.”

The alley says: “Look at our distribution.”

And this is where the methods—the boring math methods, the geometry methods, the representation methods—become more than nerd toys. They become moral instruments.

Because when you reduce dimensions, you reveal structure. When you reveal structure, you can argue about causes instead of drowning in anecdotes. You can ask: what variables actually govern suffering? Which constraints are binding? Which interventions are real, and which are just hashtags?

This is true beyond poverty. In biology, dimensionality reduction helps find hidden patterns in gene expression—how thousands of genes dance together in a smaller number of “programs.” In physics, we search for low-dimensional laws under high-dimensional measurements. In climate, we compress chaotic weather into meaningful modes. In neuroscience, we try to decode mind-states from ridiculous torrents of neural activity.

The world is high-dimensional. Understanding is compression. The danger is compressing the wrong way—discarding the human as noise.

So the final irony is this: the same mathematical instinct that helps a machine learn can also help a society see. But only if it wants to see. Only if it cares what the compact representation reveals. Only if it doesn’t treat the poor as a rounding error.

The ceiling fan wobbles. The 8K walker turns a corner into a street so clean it looks rendered. My phone heats up, the battery drops, the algorithm politely offers me another paradise.

I lock the screen.

The room returns in low resolution: the faint hum of a transformer, the sticky air, the soft tyranny of hunger and thirst waiting, patiently, like ancient gods that never needed a brochure.
