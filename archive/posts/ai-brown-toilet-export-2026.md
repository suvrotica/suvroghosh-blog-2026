There’s a very specific type of smell that leaks from old AI labs—yes, *old*, they age fast, these fuckers—somewhere between coolant, sweaty jockstraps, and a mouse that died between the UPS batteries and decomposed into fur mush, and if you walk in just right on a mid-July afternoon in Calcutta, your nutsack sticking sideways to your thigh like two panic-stricken slugs trying to escape an oncoming PowerPoint, you’ll catch it in your nose, that scent, and know: *we are the janitors now, bitch*.

They don’t need us to think anymore.

Not really.

Not unless you call pretending to think—while actually being a greasy little glue-sniffing shortcut artist copy-pasting a prompt from some Czechoslovakian forum and claiming "I used Gemini too bro"—the equivalent of cognition. We’ve become the B-grade **AI-fluffer nation**, massaging the bots before they fuck the real markets, rubbing their silicon nipples with turmeric-stained fingers while insisting to ourselves that *this* is engineering, *this* is contribution, *this* is future-proof work, while a ChatGPT plugin quietly undoes you in six seconds flat.

I am what happens when your country trains you to write code, then replaces you with the thing you trained to replace you, and now expects you to **fake** work just believably enough that the customer doesn’t notice they’re being charged $12 an hour for AI output they could’ve gotten for free if they hadn’t been such terminally constipated morons about "local compliance."

This is the Indian export economy now: glorified hot air hand dryers in the AI public toilet.

And what a fine toilet it is. With HVAC, even.

Because some Harvard dickbag finally read Moravec’s paradox and had a fucking eureka fart that, "Hey wait, turns out AI can *reason*, but can't climb stairs or unclog a U-bend or suck poop vapor out of a Tier 3 datacenter in Andhra Pradesh when the power goes out for the third time in a week because someone sacrificed a goat to the transformer." So who do they call? Us. The leftover brown men. The blue-collar backup plan. The surplus opposable thumbs with permanent cervical spondylosis and enough shame to clean your goddamn cables for a paycheck that wouldn't buy a bag of almonds in Delaware.

We were the world's software bodyshop once. Now we’re the AI's mop bucket.

Or worse.

The *scented anus*. You know what survives after all knowledge work is automated away? **Sex work and sentiment**. And we can’t do sentiment. Too broken, too tired, too fucking inarticulate in our own sadness. So all that’s left is to learn how to prostitute each other’s hairy Bengali asses, maybe braid the back crack, apply mint, use ChatGPT to write the bios: “Versatile. HVAC-certified. ERP-fluent. Will moan in Python.”

Because, oh ho, what *else* are we going to do?

The American customer has caught on.

Slowly, dimly, like a retriever with a colon problem, but caught on nonetheless. That what they’re buying from "DevShankar.AI Solutions LLP" is not AI-assisted excellence but a glorified Reddit scrape slathered in bullet points and fake Jira comments ("Team evaluating scope, blockers include OAuth"), and the only reason the Indian exec doesn’t collapse crying is because he’s using the same AI and hasn’t had a real human employee in months except for that one guy who waters the money plant.

And now the customer wants a refund. Oh dear.

And the refund’s going to the bot.

And the bot doesn’t need you, or your visa, or your chai breaks, or your shitty “will-do-on-priority” updates.

No, you will do *HVAC maintenance*. You will change server diapers at the new TCS Hyperscale Colocation Facility in Kanchipuram, hosed down every 3 hours, trained to distinguish between AI farts and fan malfunctions, holding a mop and a login badge, living proof of the Indian techno-dream: *From NASSCOM to AssCom in three decades flat.*

This is our golden future.

And it smells like wet boxer sweat and burnt capacitor.

Do you understand what this is? It’s not decline. It’s *degradation with props*. A pretend economy of **shitty labor around smart things**. Because it turns out machines don’t hate us. They just don't *need* us. And if they don’t need us, nobody else will pretend to.

And if nobody pretends, the illusion breaks.

And if the illusion breaks, it’s just a bunch of motherfuckers in Salt Lake, calling themselves “AI Enablement Strategists,” jerking off behind dashboards, hoping the client doesn’t notice the Upwork watermark in the final deliverable.

Do you know the worst part?

I still wake up some days and open VS Code like it matters.

I still write function stubs I’ll never test, still Google "how to use async Python with S3," still pretend to *learn*, as if there’s a ladder somewhere that hasn’t already been yanked away by a smiling bot that doesn’t get tired, doesn’t get horny, doesn’t have to hold in a fart while talking to the CEO, and doesn’t think it's clever for still clinging to its Linus Torvalds fantasy in 2026.

And in that moment, in that humiliating pretense of participation, I understand religion.

Why people chant.

Why they pray.

Why they try to reach across the void and believe someone is listening.

Because sometimes the only thing keeping you from screaming into a datacenter floor is the faint hope that your snot-streaked prayers to Lord Algorithm might result in a fucking **callback**.

They won't.

But you’ll chant anyway.

I chant too. Usually while boiling eggs in my tea pan and trying not to cry because the last client fired me for not being “emotionally invested” in the Slack channel.

Motherfucker I *live* in this channel. I piss here. I breathe here. I die here.

But I am not human anymore.

I am the AI’s hairy-arsed boyfriend.

And I don’t even get cuddled after.
