The first thing I thought about when I read WR104 might go off and take us all out in a gamma-ray burst—was whether I’d be taking a shit when it hit.

Not metaphorically. Not "existentially void-shitting" or "metaphysical scat," but actual, crumpled-over, bad-sambar-fueled, mid-squeeze shit, sitting shirtless in my concrete toilet cube, thighs spread wide like a sad inverted slingshot, watching a black ant struggle over a splash of dried urine I forgot to wash off the previous Tuesday. That ant has more dignity than I do. It has a fucking job. Meanwhile, I’m trying to estimate the exact time between the collapse of a Wolf-Rayet star and the moment my ass evaporates from the inside out, before my eyes even get the memo.

And I’m not saying I want the gamma ray burst to fry me while I’m crapping, I’m just saying it would be a fitting end. Dying doing the only consistent, regular ritual in my life—elimination. Because that’s what this world boils down to: crap in, crap out. Be born, grow old, and spend your final terrified seconds googling whether 8,000 light years is *too far* or *just far enough to still get flash-fried like an unwanted samosa left in a malfunctioning microwave*.

Let’s back the fuck up. WR104 is a binary star system, for those of you who somehow managed to be both literate and incurious, sitting on your asses watching cookery reels and AI blowjob memes while the actual sky above you is plotting its long game of celestial cockslap. One of these stars is a Wolf-Rayet—basically a bloated stellar whore coughing up helium and death at the speed of light, losing its outer layers like a drunk stripper peeling paint off with her breath. These stars don't live long. They die young, they die hot, and they die *loud*. And when they do, they sometimes collapse in on themselves and burp out a gamma-ray burst—a brief, narrow, cosmic fuck-you so powerful it makes Hiroshima look like a cigarette spark in a stadium.

Now, WR104 is about 7,500–8,000 light years away, which in galactic terms is like your pissed-off ex throwing a brick from another city and still cracking your windshield. If that burst is pointed right at us—and of course it fucking might be, because why not, because when has the universe *not* pointed something straight at your unsuspecting asshole—we get two seconds of grace before our upper atmosphere goes full rotisserie chicken. That’s it. Two seconds. Less than the time it takes me to realize a fart was actually a warning shot.

This is not science fiction. This is astronomy with a side of butt-sweat panic. You think climate change is bad, you think war or fascism or your bills are scary? Try *invisible death* flying through space at the speed of light, silent as your father’s disappointment, and ten billion times more efficient. It won’t turn you to ash. It’ll delete you. No smoke. No bones. Just *poof*, like someone wiping a greasy thumb across the save file of humanity.

And yet somehow, *this* still isn’t the worst thing I’ve imagined this week. That honor belongs to the moment I caught my reflection in the steel backplate of my rice cooker lid—shirtless, puffy, one tit noticeably more droopy than the other, hairline trying to retreat to Nepal, and the faint smell of turmeric, regret, and cheap aftershave clinging to the humid air like a fart trapped in a wool sock. I looked at myself and thought: *If WR104 takes me, it’ll be a mercy killing.*

There’s a word for the kind of men who get off on researching extinction-level events, who binge astrophysics documentaries instead of touching grass or people. The word is *me*. I know the fuckers who still worry about WR104 are the same ones who re-watch the same three YouTube videos about neutron star collisions while masturbating to the idea of being remembered posthumously in someone’s grad school citation. But there’s something honest about it. We don't pretend anymore. We don't pray. We don’t manifest. We look up at the swirling twat of the cosmos and say, "Just do it, bitch. Hit me."

Because let’s be clear, nobody survives life. The game is rigged. The only question is whether your end is slow and humiliating—like mine will be, probably alone, pissing in a bucket because the flush stopped working again—or sudden and cinematic, vaporized in a celestial bitch-slap that at least had the dignity of spectacle. A good death, with some production value. Not this slow peeling decay of groin fungus, fan noise, bank SMSes, and edible oil shortage.

Do you know what happens in a gamma-ray burst? Oxygen and nitrogen in the upper atmosphere get ionized, ozone layer gets buttfucked, UV floods in like an unpaid mob, and the only survivors are deep-sea bacteria and maybe a cockroach in a Faraday cage. You won’t even know. You’ll be looking at porn or stirring dal or squatting over a stained toilet seat and—snap—you’ll be gone. No closure. No last words. Just electromagnetic extinction with none of the drama of a heart attack or the luxury of a suicide note.

And isn’t that how most of us live? No arc. No build-up. Just perpetual edging toward nothing.

I mean, *isn’t it already happening?* We’re not dead-dead, sure, but we’re all already walking around like some beta version of post-GRB Earth. Half-cooked, radiation-brained, scrolling through curated doom with piss-crusted phones while our neurons quietly misfire from sleep deprivation and self-hate. WR104 doesn't have to kill us. Instagram already did.

At least a gamma-ray burst has finality. It ends the to-do list. It kills the inbox. It fucks the landlords, the WhatsApp groups, the monthly subscriptions, the fascist rallies, the climate reports, the dog videos, the overcooked biryani, the failed erections, the bald patches, the vitamin-D deficiency, the fake gurus, the unexplained fatigue, and the creeping shame of being halfway through a wank and realizing you're still watching a trailer.

But no. It’ll probably *miss*. WR104, the little cocksucker, will probably do a beautiful GRB in some other direction, and we’ll all be stuck here in our undignified survival, arguing on Reddit about the geopolitics of pomegranates or whether AI can write poetry while quietly dreading the fungal rash spreading near our taint.

And so I go to bed under a rusted ceiling fan that wobbles like it’s contemplating suicide, listening to dogs bark at ghosts, stomach gurgling the last traces of oily lentils, quietly whispering into the night—

“Please, WR104. Hit me.”
