I drew it on my Samsung S9 Ultra tab in Sketchbook, using that slightly apologetic digital charcoal brush that always looks like it wants to be a real pencil when it grows up, and I wrote, in the top margin with my best imitation of certainty: “INDIAN BMI is exponential.” The woman beneath the words is sweating, ballooned, staring up at the ceiling as if the ceiling might offer a dividend or a diagnosis, and when I finished, I just sat there for a while with the stylus hovering, not because I was proud of the drawing—this isn’t the Sistine Chapel, it’s my rented room with a fan that wheezes like an elderly bureaucrat—but because the sentence felt true in that irritating way truths do, the way an EMI feels true when it arrives every month whether you’re in the mood for arithmetic or not.

Exponential, yes. That’s the word we use when we want to sound mathematical about a phenomenon that feels like it’s getting away from us—like EMI. Monthly installments. The polite, middle-class leash around your ankle. You buy a refrigerator, you buy a scooter, you buy a little rectangle of “future security,” and then the future arrives as a bill with compound interest and a smile. BMI, in this telling, is the body’s EMI: you don’t exactly *choose* it so much as you sign up for a lifestyle, a food environment, a work rhythm, a stress chemistry, and then discover that the payments are due in flesh.

I remember—annoyingly, sentimentally—that in my childhood the neighborhood had many things, including hunger, but not much visible bulk. Men were wiry. Women were compact and fast, like they had been designed by some Bengali engineer who hated wasted material. If an uncle had a protruding belly, it was notable, like a new building suddenly blocking the winter sun. The elephant and hippo sightings—those crude zoological metaphors we used when we were young and unkind—were rare enough to become characters, and Kolkata loves characters the way it loves traffic jams: it will create a story out of anything that won’t move.

Now I stand in a line at a pharmacy—fluorescent light, overworked pharmacist, a queue of people with that patient, defeated expression Indians perfect early—and I can’t help noticing how many bodies look like they’ve been quietly renegotiated by the last twenty years. Not necessarily heavier in a dramatic, tabloid way. Something subtler and more ominous. More soft mass around the waist, more puffiness around the face, the tired posture of metabolic debt. The city has acquired a new silhouette.

And before I get too righteous—before I climb onto my little soapbox made of second-hand books and moral superiority—I should confess: my own body is not a steel girder of self-control. I have lived on tea and biscuits. I have eaten late at night because the mind was whirring and the stomach was the only thing that could be bribed into silence. I have used food the way this country uses committees: not to solve the problem, but to create the sensation that a problem is being handled.

The trouble is that “fatness” (let’s use a word that doesn’t spit on people) is not a single moral failure you can scold away with inspirational posters and military metaphors. It’s a system. It’s biology meeting economics in a dark alley and exchanging envelopes.

BMI itself is a hilariously blunt instrument for such a complex situation. A ratio—weight divided by height squared—pretending to be a verdict. The square is not even poetic; it’s a compromise from the nineteenth century, like a colonial railway timetable. Bodies aren’t squares. Bodies are history. Bodies are hormones, sleep, muscle, poverty, trauma, starch, celebration, office chairs, and the strange modern miracle of never being truly hungry while still being undernourished.

Also, Indians have a special talent for confounding neat Western categories. There’s that now-common observation—half clinical, half insulting—that we can be “thin-fat”: not necessarily large by the old visual standards, yet carrying dangerous fat in the belly, around the organs, the stealth kind that doesn’t announce itself until the blood tests do. The body can look “acceptable” and still be quietly smoldering. A nation of respectable-looking volcanoes.

So why does it feel exponential? Because the forces feeding it compound.

Start with food, since we always start with food—India can argue about anything except lunch. We have moved from food as a local negotiation (seasonal, perishable, limited by what the bazaar had that day) to food as an industrial product (shelf-stable, aggressively marketed, engineered to be hard to stop eating). This is not some romantic myth of the past where everyone ate simple grains and danced gracefully through sunsets. We ate sugar then too. We fried things then too. We had ghee and mishti and *telebhaja* and the holy trinity of Bengali self-destruction: rice, potatoes, and the belief that walking to the bus stop counts as exercise.

But the new thing is scale. The new thing is precision. The new thing is that somewhere a team of professionals has tuned the salt-fat-sugar triangle the way a sound engineer tunes a pop song: not too much, not too little, exactly enough to make your brain say, *one more,* even when your stomach is filing a formal complaint.

And then—because the universe loves to add insult with a spreadsheet—there is stress. Not the dramatic stress of famine, which is at least honest, but the modern stress of job insecurity, debt, noise, screens, sleep that isn’t sleep. Stress is not just a mood; it’s chemistry. Cortisol doesn’t care about your political views. Your body reacts to threat the way it did when threats had teeth. Now the threats arrive as emails.

Poor sleep, more hunger hormones. More hunger hormones, more snacking. More snacking, more insulin spikes. More insulin spikes, more fat storage. And fat itself is not inert, not a passive suitcase of calories, but a loud endocrine organ sending signals—leptin, inflammatory markers, all of it—so the whole system becomes a feedback loop, a circular argument you can’t win by shouting.

Exponential is what feedback looks like when it’s wearing a sari.

There’s also a linguistic joke hiding here, which my brain cannot resist. People invent folk etymologies with great confidence—confident nonsense is our national renewable resource. I once heard someone claim “obese” comes from “obey,” as in “you obey your appetite,” which is charmingly moralistic and completely wrong. The actual root is Latin: *obesus*, from *edere*, “to eat,” with an intensifier stuck in front—essentially “having eaten too much.” It’s brutally literal, like a bureaucratic file note. No poetry. Just consumption and consequence.

But if you really want poetry, you don’t need Latin. You can take the Bengali word *pet*—belly—and notice how it sits at the center of our idioms. *Pet-bharā* (full-bellied) as a kind of basic success. *Pet khārāp* (bad stomach) as shorthand for general misery. A good life, in the most ordinary sense, is still measured by whether the belly has been satisfied. We are a civilization that knows hunger, and that memory doesn’t vanish just because delivery apps arrive with promo codes and the promise of frictionless excess.

America enters here—not as a villain twirling a mustache, but as an export system. Not jazz, not science, not the gorgeous rebelliousness of real American art, but the industrial American idea that food is not culture, it is a commodity, and commodities must scale, and scaling means making ingredients cheaper, flavors louder, portions bigger, and marketing more shameless. That template travels beautifully. It doesn’t need a passport. It only needs aspirational anxiety.

And India, always eager to learn the worst lessons quickly, has adapted the template with local genius. We can deep-fry anything, yes, but now we can deep-fry it *and* wrap it in plastic *and* sell it as “energy.” We can take the ancient comfort of snacks and turn them into a daily habit rather than an occasional joy. We can take sugar—once an expensive colonial luxury, then a proud symbol of modern plenty—and make it the default background radiation of life.

Meanwhile, we have redesigned the day. Children sit. Adults sit. Old men sit and give political speeches to no one in particular. Movement has been outsourced. The body has been demoted from “tool of living” to “transport for the head.” We have created a society where the most physically demanding act in many lives is lifting a water bottle to the mouth.

And then, because irony is a reliable landlord, we moralize the outcome. We treat weight like a character flaw. We turn bodies into punchlines. We do this even while knowing—if we’re honest for five seconds—that most of this is not about individual willpower in some heroic vacuum. It’s about the environment we built, the incentives we allowed, the cheap calories we subsidized with our collective indifference.

I look again at my sweating figure under that smug mathematical word, and she doesn’t feel like a joke anymore. She looks exhausted in a way that feels uncomfortably familiar: the exhaustion of carrying not just flesh but expectation—be productive, be modern, be cheerful, be “fit,” be thin, be successful, be grateful, pay your EMI, pay your BMI, and don’t complain too loudly because someone will always remind you that worse things exist.

Outside my window the Joynogorer Moya vendor calls out, the sound stretching thin through the damp air, sweet and insistent, and I think of numbers the way we think of gods: as if naming them makes them manageable.

The stylus is still on the table.

The ceiling is still blank.

The body, as usual, is the only ledger that never forgets.
