It started, as all good horror stories do, with my left testicle itching like it had developed its own nervous system and a grudge. I scratched, I confess, with the absentminded gusto of a man reading Thomas Hobbes and drinking leftover beer from the night before (warmed by room temperature and the comforting radiation of a broken fridge compressor), when I noticed something moving—not metaphorically, not emotionally, but *literally fucking crawling*—like a parasite with purpose, with a resume and a pension plan.

That’s when I saw it. The pubic louse.

Not a metaphor. Not a symbol for loneliness or capitalism or Bengali stagnation. No. Just a six-legged cunt with a clinger's heart and pincers that could shame your ex.

It wasn’t alone.

My boxers—those noble rags stitched sometime during the reign of UPA-1—had become a kind of Noah’s Ark for scavenging Calcutta fauna: half-torn elastic harboring microscopic vagabonds who didn’t pay rent, didn’t believe in personal space, and certainly didn’t give a fuck that I had an exam dream last night and woke up sweating like a rogan josh.

Let’s take inventory, shall we?

One: the bed bugs, who seem to have evolved neural nets better than GPT, capable of predictive modeling based on my sleep cycles and depressive episodes. These bloodsucking PhDs know *exactly* when I’ve hit REM and stage a 3 AM buffet. They are communists in the worst way—not in theory but in practice—redistributing MY blood into THEIR fucking kin, and then leaving itchy Marxist manifestos all over my thigh creases.

Two: cockroaches. Of course. This is Calcutta, not Copenhagen. And these aren’t your standard-issue, retiree roaches from dusty textbook pages. No. These are ruffians. Elbows out, antennae twitching with toxic masculinity, full of rage and gutterwater and gastrointestinal resilience. They drink from my toothbrush mug. They’ve claimed the dark spot under the rice cooker as *sovereign territory*, and I don’t enter unarmed anymore. I once saw one piss in my mustard oil.

Three: the geckos. These are the **passive-aggressive fucks** of the animal kingdom. Unblinking. Pale. Motionless observers of your collapse. Like failed therapists. They don’t even *eat* the roaches anymore. They just watch. Judging me. Silently flicking their tongues like they’re composing a Yelp review of my sadness.

Four: a bloom of fungus along the baseboard. Creamy. Spongy. Recurring. Like my mother’s disappointments or state-sanctioned fascism. Sometimes it talks. Not out loud—but in the odor, the musk, the pheromonal Morse code it emits into my skull cavities when I’m trying to write or masturbate. Smells like expired curd and resentment.

And five: the return of the pubic lice. Did I mention them? Of course I did. Because *they fucking demand attention*. Parasites with the ego of WhatsApp uncles. I tried drowning them in Dettol and disrespect. I tried tweezers, mirrors, Google, and finally, beer. Not pouring it on them, mind you—just drinking it fast enough that I might hallucinate them gone.

Spoiler: Didn’t work.

Meanwhile, outside, the air smells like a cricket stadium’s unwashed jockstrap, and the fungus inside is starting to look like geography—my bathroom wall has a spongy little Kashmir-shaped bit that grows more aggressive during monsoon, and I swear to fuck it flinches when I shower.

And you want to talk about hygiene?

Let’s talk colonial plumbing. The British left us railways and syphilis and a pipe system that is essentially an archaeological exhibit of 1880s engineering filtered through caste, bribes, and spit. Nothing drains. Everything accumulates. Every fart is sacred. Every turd negotiates its exit like a shy diplomat. My sink has a worldview.

And I sit—shirtless, rash-ridden, philosopher-cum-itinerant corpse—on this cot that was probably built during Operation Blue Star, scratching my pubes with a pencil I last used for differential equations, wondering which insect will rise next and declare itself my landlord.

I called the pest control guy once. He came, looked around, lit a cigarette, and said, “Dada, this is not infestation. This is ecosystem.”

I paid him five hundred and offered him a beer.

He sprayed a chemical that smelled like Kerosene had fucked a jasmine air freshener and left.

Next day, three bed bugs were doing the bhangra on my ass crack.

It is no longer clear who owns this apartment. The mushrooms have voting rights. The roaches are unionized. The geckos have squatter privileges. I’m just the idiot who pays electricity bills and buys antiseptic for the lice orgies.

But it’s not just physical. It’s spiritual. Existential.

This skin—mine, if that word even means anything anymore—is a kind of failing border patrol between me and everything outside, which is always, relentlessly, trying to get in. Fungus, politics, fascism, porn ads, WhatsApp relatives, bad faith, shame.

Even now, I feel an itch.

Could be psychological.
Could be a tick.
Could be God.
Probably lice.

And while the fuckers skitter and squirt and suck, I drink the beer, stare at the old geyser pipe, wonder whether I could grow mushrooms in my belly button as a side hustle. Maybe sell them on Etsy. "Organic Apartment-Foraged Psilocybin Starter Kit."

Just kidding. I wouldn’t do that. I’m too scared of hallucinating the truth: that I was never meant to be here. That this apartment was never empty. That I was the infestation.

Anyway, I have to go now. There’s something nesting in my soap dish.

It blinked.
