It started with a boil on the inner thigh that refused to burst. Just sat there, a sullen fat cunt of a thing, like an overfed maggot curling under skin, half-pus, half-regret, located inconveniently where my balls meet my loneliness. A humid fucking canyon of grief. I would scratch it at night, through the pantyhole I’d torn open just enough to tickle but not enough to pleasure, because pleasure these days is more hypothetical than Pluto’s planetary status and about as cold.

I learned the word “crevasse” from *Tintin in Tibet*, page seventeen or thereabouts, right after Chang fell and everyone got all melodramatic and European about it. I was nine. I thought it meant snow crack. I didn’t realize it would be the topological summary of my adulthood. Because reader, the real crevasse wasn’t in the fucking Tibet—it was the long frozen gorge between who you thought you’d be and the trench-beside-a-sewer you end up squatting in, at 50, adjusting your balls on a plastic stool while your rice overcooks in the electric cooker that clicks in that judgmental "I’m done, you sad bastard" tone.

Pollyanna-me had dreams. Pollyanna-me thought girls would like someone who knew words like “crevasse” and “liminal.” Pollyanna-me thought loneliness was a temporary hydrological condition, like a puddle or a flood, not a fucking tectonic plate you spend decades tumbling down while pretending you're climbing.

Back then I thought rationality would win. That if you explained clearly enough, if you were clean and right and fact-filled like a Bournvita ad voiced by Satyajit Ray, the world would see the truth and adjust its bra strap accordingly.

Now I know truth is a skidmark in the collective underpant of civilization. We all smell it. We just pretend it’s sandalwood.

Science, which I once jerked off to like it was a cosplaying schoolgirl in a differential equations uniform, has also turned on me. The mind is not an emergent miracle; it’s a fart caught in a cathedral. You light a candle to cover it up but everyone still smells the sulphur.

I used to sketch diagrams of crevasses. Now I have them between my asscheeks. 

You think this is metaphor? It’s not. I’ve literally got a scrotal skinfold so deep I’ve lost a coin in it. Couldn’t find it for three days. It was a ₹5 coin. New one. Shiny as hope. 

Found it again after a week, stuck to a leftover bit of Dettol-soaked cotton I’d wedged in there because the pus from the thigh-boil started dripping into my boxers and I didn’t want to do laundry. Didn’t throw it out. Dipped it in hot water, rubbed it clean, used it to pay for a loose cigarette and some green banana chips the next morning. Economy of scale.

The thing about Tintin is he never fucks. No boners, no wet dreams, no crushes. You ever seen a cumshot in a Hergé panel? Exactly. That’s how you know he’s fictional. All action, no aftermath. Like an Indian government scheme. Or my twenties.

There are nights I piss six times between 2 and 5 a.m. because my prostate thinks it’s funny. Each time the stream is thinner, sadder, a little more like a dying boy soprano auditioning for a piss opera no one wants to hear. The sound of it hitting the commode is the only applause I get. Not even the lizards clap anymore.

Meanwhile, Facebook shows me ads for geriatric diapers, and a twenty-two-year-old bikini model with the IQ of chapati flour and lips designed by a bored AI who thinks men over forty still have hope. I stare. I tap. I feel bad. I scroll. I fart.

I tried therapy. The therapist was younger than my last bottle of mustard oil. She used words like “boundaries” and “inner child.” My inner child is dead, sweetheart. He fell into a crevasse in Tibet.

She said, “You’re catastrophizing.” I said, “You’re billing me ₹1,800 to say that?”

Even my farts sound different now. They used to be confident. Brassy. Jazz-band flatulence. Now they’re whispered and wet, like a defeated MLA’s resignation letter.

There’s a tree outside my shanty. Half-dead. Bent. Fungal patches where the leaves should be. I relate to it so much I almost asked it to marry me. But she’s taken. By termites. Like all the good ones.

Sometimes I look up and think, what would it be like to just ascend? To be one of those men who actually climbs the mountain, emotionally or physically, doesn’t matter, the metaphor is flexible like a drunk yoga instructor. But my knees say no. My cholesterol says no. My inertia screams “sit the fuck down you delusional crinkled foreskin of a human.”

And so I descend. Further. Past the haunches of desire, into the perineum of despair. Into the gorge. The word “crevasse” has too much elegance now. I prefer “asscrack.” It’s what it is. A hairy, itchy, gassy trench with echoes. Welcome to the base camp.

Someday, some poor mountain climber’s going to stumble across my fossil. Not in snow, but in a heap of unpaid electricity bills and yellowing dream-journals I never filled. He’ll dig me out, brush off the dandruff, and say: “Was this… a man?”

No kid. I was a footnote. A wet one. Between Tintin’s boots and a forgotten word in a dictionary that smells like mildew and regret.
