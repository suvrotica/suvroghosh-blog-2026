I was shitting when the thought occurred.

And I don’t mean one of those slippery, banana-peel soft-dumps that slither out like a loyal worker clocking out at 5:01. I mean a **lumpy, semi-tumescent fucking asshole-ripper**, the kind of turd that makes you sweat before you even squat. The kind that teaches you humility. Makes you negotiate with your gods, your rectum, and the **interstellar fucking void**, because while your anus is splitting into Morse code blisters, your brain—mine, in this case—starts whispering: *what if it’s already here? what if the fucking black hole is already sniffing at our corner of the galaxy like some interstellar rapist raccoon, invisible, hungry, inevitable?*

This is not a metaphor.

I mean a literal rogue black hole, those ungravitationally leashed motherfuckers that got booted from their original galaxy like a drunk twat at a wedding and now just **wander**, **drift**, **slurp**, **consume** like a cocksucker with no gag reflex and a fetish for planets. No spin. No warning. No cosmic courtesy tap.

We could die tonight and not even know it.

And I’d die on the shitter, pants around ankles, still trying to pinch off a reluctant turd that’s now fossilizing inside my traitor colon, while a silent sphere of infinite gravity and zero fucks **unzips reality like a prolapsed anus in reverse**.

Let me tell you something about wandering black holes. First: they exist. Second: they are **undetectable unless they’re feeding**. And third: *statistically*, one of them should've passed within 100 light-years of us by now. Maybe it already did. Maybe it *is*. Maybe that's why I can't get an erection without a Ted Chiang story playing in the background and a third-world oil massage.

You think I’m exaggerating?

Of course you do, because you're a fucking optimist. Because your body doesn't hurt yet. Or if it does, you’re still stupid enough to think you can *fix* it—yoga, turmeric, kombucha, vitamin D enemas, whatever shiny rectal placebo you rub on your mortality.

Me, I’ve got sciatica, cracked heel, bile reflux, and the faint lingering suspicion that my left kidney's playing *fuck-you* jazz solos when I sleep. Every morning is a fresh audition for the role of "Coughing Fuck About to Die of Minor Infection."

We’ll get back to the black holes, I promise, but first—since I brought it up—**have you ever noticed how utterly useless the human body is** in the face of cosmic risk?

I mean, let’s say some snub-nosed, non-accreting stellar-mass black hole just waltzes into the solar system on a vector out of Buttfuck Sagittarius. Do you know what our response would be? Some 27-year-old white boy with a nose piercing at NASA would tweet *“we’re monitoring the situation”* and **that would be the last thing posted** before your dick sublimated into neutrinos and your spine did a 4D origami collapse through your own cockhole.

And meanwhile your phone would still be auto-updating.

I read somewhere—we don’t know how many rogue black holes are out there because most of them don’t eat. They're celibate. And the only way we spot them is by watching stars *lensing*—warping light as they pass behind a gravitational field. Some tiny tug on a pixel. Blink, and your star does a little jiggle. That’s it. That’s the sign. That’s the **death knell**.

A shimmer.

And if you're old like me and your eyes have floaters, you might just blink back at the end of all things, thinking it was an eyelash. *Whoops.*

Science always gives you two options: dignity or despair. But either way, you’re going to shit yourself.

Now let’s talk about trajectories. These bastards are **not tethered**. They roam like horny gods with no followers. A supernova farts wrong, and boom, the neutron star gets ejected like an angry hemorrhoid across the galaxy. Black holes form when a big star dies dramatically, shitting its own gravitational pants so hard that even light says *fuck this, I’m out*.

Then they wander. No accountability. No insurance. No goddamn headlights.

You think death will come from war or water or some fucking spreadsheet virus made by an autistic finance bro with a genocide fetish?

No, motherfucker. *Death will come from silence.* A nothing so perfect it can’t be detected. Not even with your fancy LIGO, not even with your web telescopes and global warming hashtags.

You won’t *see* your death. You’ll *feel* it. In the blood. In your balls. In the way your soup gets slightly too thick one night and your ears ring differently and you just *know*—somehow—that **space itself has shifted**, and it’s coming. For you. For everyone.

Do you know what happens when one of these things gets close?

Tidal disruption.

Which sounds like a spa treatment but is actually **being stretched like spaghetti through your own nipples while time has a seizure around your ankles**. Earth would quake, your magnetic field would puke, tectonic plates would do drunk bhangra, and you'd find yourself flung into the void like a cumshot in a vacuum.

But first: your cat would stare at a wall for a second too long.

That's the only warning you're gonna get.

Anyway, the shit finally came out. It hurt. It burned like a poem by Bukowski stapled to your perineum. And in that moment of clarity, when the toilet bowl looked like a Jackson Pollock tribute to IBS and the exhaust fan squealed like a dying space probe, I thought: maybe that’s all we are.

Not stardust.

**Shit. And the fear of a cosmic butthole.**

I wiped with two-ply that felt like 19th-century colonial parchment, probably bleached with some carcinogenic chemical banned in Europe, probably made by a child working in a factory near a dried-up lake. My left hand was trembling—might be Parkinson’s, might just be guilt.

Went to the kitchen, made tea. Milk gone bad. Fuck it. Drank it anyway. I mean what’s the worst that could happen, I already lived through enough.

Still tasted better than the air in my room today.

And now I’m sitting here, typing with a hunchback spine and an oily keyboard that smells faintly of sambar and despair, wondering—not if—but **when**. Because it's not *if*.

One of these motherfuckers is already on its way. And when it comes, there will be no movie, no Morgan Freeman, no elegy, no girl to kiss, no planet to save. There will be **a flicker**.

And maybe, if we’re lucky—

someone will be mid-shit when it hits.

Just like I was.

And that, my friend, is the closest thing we’ll ever get to universal justice.
