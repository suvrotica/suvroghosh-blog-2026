The water smells like someone took a cum-soaked fishnet from a whorehouse trawler off the coast of fucking Kakinada, soaked it in an old man’s diabetic urine, let it ferment under a Bakreshwar overpass in June, and then wrung it out into my taps.

I’m not being poetic.

I’m being autobiographical.

The kitchen tap gurgles this brownish half-piss, half-soup liquid with a hint of polyvinyl chloride and post-menopausal grief, and I’m supposed to wash my rice cooker with this, scrub my balding skull, rinse spoons that once carried ghee and now reek of marine yeast infection. And then what? Heat that stench into edible submission? Burn it off with turmeric? Pretend the RO filter isn’t the last remaining technological miracle in this cesspool of a civic plumbing system designed by a fucking half-literate contract-bidder who probably smells like the water himself?

You know what's funny—funny like a gangrenous toe in a comedy skit about dance shoes? My bowel movements smell *better* than this water. That’s right. My shits, with their proud steaming columns and hints of mustard seed and existential crisis, at least carry the honest stench of digestion, effort, life. This? This water smells like a corpse’s underboob, like sewage that tried to get a college degree and failed halfway through its second semester.

And the irony, if we must name this festering ulcer of irony, is that it’s *treated*. Yes, chemically purified, chlorinated to a degree that'd make Auschwitz engineers slow clap. You can smell the hypochlorite tears of a thousand overpaid municipal workers who think they’re saving humanity by dumping industrial bleach into aquifers that already tasted like a mackerel’s menstrual pad. And if you don’t like that metaphor, you’re free to lick my dinner plate after it’s been washed in this aquatic miscarriage.

Now, I’m not trying to be political here. I am, quite literally, trying not to shit my brains out while brushing my teeth.

But let’s talk math. Because this isn't just a hygiene issue. It’s transitive fucking logic. A→B→C logic. The government fucks democracy. Democracy, limping and pantless, then fucks us. Result? The government is fucking us, consistently, prolifically, missionary-style on Republic Day with a saffron strap-on and a whisper of development in our ears like, “shhh, baby, just swallow the policy.”

It’s not ideological. It’s not BJP vs TMC vs Congress vs Elmo’s People’s Revolutionary Communist Kink Posse. It’s simply a question of volume. Volume of shit they can pour into our taps, our lungs, our schools, our news, and how efficiently they can tell us it's artisanal mineral water hand-collected from the tears of Himalayan monks with diarrhea.

I once used the tap water to wash my balls.

Just once.

The next morning I woke up with a rash so biblical it might’ve convinced Job to give up. Red welts, like Morse code for “you are a fucking idiot,” appeared around my groin. I Googled the symptoms—chlorine burns, fungal bloom, maybe a ghost of some extinct mollusk from the Hooghly embedded in the scrotal folds. My doctor, a distracted prick who smells like Dettol and erectile regret, told me to stop using the tap. Not drink, not touch. Just avoid it like it’s radioactive. But not in writing, of course. Never in writing. That might “implicate the system.”

Fuck your system. I’m bathing in bottled resignation.

And yet, the irony squirts on, like the last drop of wet fart from a constipated auntie trying to do yoga in Ultadanga. My rent’s gone up. My electricity bill’s gone up. The cost of the RO filter changes every goddamn month like it’s indexed to how many bureaucrats needed kidney dialysis from drinking their own lies.

And it’s not just me.

Every house in this colony—this post-apocalyptic expanse with its turmeric-flecked terraces and CCTV-controlled ghettos of middle-class decay—is using water that smells like a sushied tampon. Every child brushing their teeth is holding in their gag reflex. Every elderly man washing his dentures is doing so with the same water that would make a sewer rat cross itself.

But what are we gonna do? Protest?

Please.

We’ll tweet. We’ll meme. We’ll write reviews on Google Maps about the “water quality of this prestigious housing complex” while sipping RO water poured into cheap Chinese steel tumblers. We’ll say things like “this country needs change” while adjusting the knob on our water purifiers and calculating how many units of TDS is still technically nonlethal.

Meanwhile, the councilor is buying a new car. A big fucker with alloy wheels and a color so loud it could blind traffic cops. And guess what—he probably doesn’t drink this water. He probably imports his piss from Singapore. He probably thinks the stench of our water is a feature, a cultural marker, an authentic Kolkata experience—like fish curry or noise pollution or casual molestation.

Here’s a thought.

Maybe the tap water *is* democracy.

Looks clean from afar. Promises nourishment. Delivered by rusted pipes held together with spit, wire, and religious slogans. Tastes like a corpse’s toe jam.

Filtered water is what we *want* democracy to be. But that requires effort. Pressure. Carbon blocks. A membrane that rejects shit.

No one's building membranes.

Everyone’s bottling the stink.

And me? I’m standing at the kitchen sink, sniffing my plates like a deranged sommelier of rot, wondering if today’s eau de toilette will be more “feral haddock with notes of piss” or “guppy abortion overlaid with chlorinated foreskin.”

Maybe it doesn’t matter.

Maybe this is it.

Maybe the final symptom of civilization isn’t collapse.

It’s the moment you stop noticing your food smells like taint.
