There's something inherently fishy—like two-day-old betki belly sitting warm on the marble counter—about big fucking art. Big canvas, big frame, big neck strain, big price tag. The kind of grotesquely sized oil monstrosities that require spinal surgery just to look at properly, usually loitering in rooms filled with artificially preserved humans pretending to be high on intellect but really just bloated with wine and invisible class farts. 

Some pasty, tuberculosis-jawed colonial cocksocket from pre-World War-anything slapped together a few swirls of oily pigment (which if you scratched a bit deeper would reveal either religious psychosis or venereal frustration), and now—decades later—a gallery wanker in a shiny suit and shoes more expensive than my goddamn refrigerator tells me it's an “exploration of light in despair”. Well no shit, Sherlock. I too get light in my despair when my toilet’s bulb flickers during a squat and I can see the haunted dingleberry trailing my rectal regrets.

The whole fucking scam is as transparent as my grandfather’s vest, yellowed with a lifetime of Calcutta humidity and his own slow death. They’ve taken what used to be private acts of madness—done on paper, on walls, on stolen ledgers with jizz-stiffened fingers—and turned it into the financial equivalent of NFT diarrhea. 

And don’t give me that bollocks about “cultural legacy.” These whiteboys weren’t revered back then. Half of them died broke, riddled with clap, hallucinating color palettes on café napkins, and now some bollard with a Sotheby’s newsletter subscription and cum-stained chin hair calls it “visionary.” Visionary my ass. It’s post-mortem wealth necrophilia. Price equals prestige equals another round of verbal pretzels served on a silver plate of bollocks.

I, on the other stunted, brown, and utterly unfuckable hand, draw in monochrome, on a digital tablet that cost me two months of skipped meat and one cancelled dentist appointment. Because color is expensive, and the pigment of imagination apparently comes with customs duty. I use a black pen and I sketch the way a dying man farts—wet, involuntary, sometimes loud, and almost always ignored by everyone within the radius of relevance. Nobody pays for it. Nobody reads the damn thing. Half my relatives are either culturally dead, busy arranging selfies with temple backgrounds, or intellectually constipated with WhatsApp PhDs in Vedic whatever-the-fuck.

Which is why I publish it anyway. On a blog nobody visits. With traffic as dead as my libido. Because there’s something violently purifying about barking into the void, especially when the void doesn’t even echo back. I do not market. I do not optimize for search. I do not create engagement. I sketch. I piss the pixels out like urinary calculus and let them rot in the rain.

Capitalism, that supremely masturbatory carnival of inflated emptiness, needs a price to justify your existence. If it costs nothing, it is nothing. Which is why you need tortured MFA cunts to defend canvas fuckery like it’s quantum field theory with a brush. “The tension between opacity and gesture”—suck my tension. My gestural opacity is when I press too hard on the stylus and my screen freezes, you neoliberal glaze donut.

Art—whatever that once meant—is now mostly about laundering old money through new galleries. Rich dead white men being blow-jobbed by the living ones with champagne and citation. All the while poor brown sketchers like me fart into Procreate and wonder if today’s attempt looks like an existential rabbit or a collapsed testicle. No one cares. That is its freedom. That is its doom.

I don’t even believe in the meritocracy of art anymore. No merit exists. Only market. If you die interestingly—preferably syphilitic, young, misunderstood, and preferably French—you will be worth something. If you live into your fifties, cooking rice alone, digitally constipated and sexually obsolete in South fucking Calcutta, you better learn to sell insurance or just draw tits for crypto degenerates.

I tried once—let me confess—to put color. A dab of red. Some ochre. I even googled “digital palettes that communicate melancholy”. Thirty seconds in, my entire colon rejected the attempt. My stylus slipped. The red bled. It looked like my tablet had its period. I took a screenshot and deleted it. I shit you not, I’ve had better color theory from maggi stains on my pillow.

So black and white it is. Stark. Cheap. Forgiving. Like the moral spectrum of my kith and kin, too proud to recognize a sketch-addicted bipolar hermit making blog posts for an audience that doesn’t exist, as one of their own. 

And here’s the real kicker—some of my art isn’t half bad. Not genius. But not sewage either. A few squiggles look like pain. A few eyes look like longing. Some noses look like poorly rendered penises. But even that is honest. Unlike the curated nothingness of gallery babble, this is private shit. Like a well-formed turd—anonymous, smooth, uncelebrated—but undeniably real.

My sketches will not be framed. They will not be discovered after my death. Because I’ll probably be cremated in a hurry to avoid property disputes, and no one will bother checking the hard disk. Maybe some cousin will find a folder labeled “sketches 2023-26” and assume it’s porn. It’s not. It’s worse. It’s the inside of my head. Unfuckable, unfixable, and—as all good things are—drawn with the left hand while the right scratches my balls.

Sometimes I think about printing them. But then I remember that Calcutta printers are all run by chai-breasted men who smell like damp socks and disappointment, and will probably crop the image, brighten it, or invert the contrast in some misguided attempt to be helpful. And I’ll have to fight. Loudly. In Bengali. With a man who believes Comic Sans is an artistic choice.

So I don’t print.

I post.

I post like a man jerking off into the abyss. Hoping the void at least flinches.

Today, I drew a man with a bird brain for a head. And because the air is so polluted I added a *biri* with an ashtray full of extinguished ones. This is what I call an early morning art fart.
