It arrived like a slow-moving landslide with ambitions, the kind of thing you don’t so much *produce* as *witness*, and I knew something had changed in the republic of my body because my asshole felt briefly like it was being asked to participate in infrastructure, like the Kolkata Municipal Corporation had come knocking in the night and said, hello sir, we’d like to widen this road by two lanes, please cooperate, and my toilet bowl, that chipped white colonial relic, sat there in the cold January air like a judge who’s seen too much, and then—there it was—this colossally huge dump, a disturbingly solid, thick, almost architectural turd that looked less like shit and more like a dark, wet brick with a future, and I stared at it the way you stare at a train accident you caused with your own intestines.

Winter makes everything more honest and more cruel. Sound carries. Smells carry. Shame carries. The air is drier, the skin feels like paper, the joints creak, the nose goes on strike, and the body—this stupid, needy, lying sack of meat—decides to remind you that you are not a mind with a membership at the library, you are a gut with delusions of philosophy. So I’m sitting there in my South Calcutta concrete exile, a man who has read too many fucking books and still can’t keep a vegetable from rotting in the fridge, and I’m watching a turd that could apply for an Aadhaar card, thinking: this is it, I’ve become a holy cow, not in some radiant spiritual way, but in the very specific Indian way where my sanctity is basically a public nuisance made of dung.

There’s a special horror in realizing you’ve surprised yourself with your own excrement. You can tell yourself all sorts of stories—rationalist, atheist, science-brained, leftist-turned-numb, blah blah blah—but none of that matters when your asshole has just delivered a manifesto. This wasn’t a casual, everyday shit. This was a statement. This was my colon standing on a soapbox and shouting into the winter: “BEHOLD, I HAVE CONVERTED YOUR BREAKFAST INTO A MONUMENT.” And because I am a pervert even in despair, a cocksucker of my own attention, my first instinct wasn’t gratitude or relief; it was humiliation mixed with an odd, involuntary awe, like seeing a circus elephant do a backflip and thinking, that shouldn’t be possible, and yet here we are.

I did what any dignified fifty-something Bengali man would do: I leaned forward and squinted like an idiot, as if closer inspection would turn it into something else—some harmless coil, some modest little turd, some polite, middle-class log that would let me wash my hands and go make tea and pretend I’m a person with a future. But no. It sat there, slick and stubborn, like the final boss in a video game designed by a sadist gastroenterologist. My brain—trained on footnotes, on colonial history, on the melancholic precision of Satyajit Ray—started doing its usual trick: turning visceral shame into overthinking, because if I can narrate it, I can control it, and if I can control it, maybe I won’t have to feel it.

So fine. Let’s narrate. Let’s pretend this is a science lesson and not a debasement.

The human colon is basically an industrial composting unit run by bacteria who don’t care about your self-image. It takes your “civilization”—your plans, your productivity fantasies, your porn tabs, your little masculine performance anxieties—and it ferments them into methane and fecal matter, and the only reason you don’t think about that all day is because consciousness is a fragile scam. Somewhere in there, my microbiome—this writhing city of microbes, this un-elected parliament—decided to hold a special session and pass a bill: “In January, we will create a turd of national significance.” Maybe I ate too much rice. Maybe I ate too little fiber, then suddenly ate fiber like a guilty man trying to bribe God with carrots. Maybe dehydration made it denser. Maybe it’s the winter, and the body hoards everything like an old miser, including shit. Or maybe my body is simply angry at me for living like a bookworm with the diet of a stray dog.

I can hear the health gurus already, the Facebook baba brigade with their turmeric breath and their smug eyes, telling me to drink warm water, to chew slowly, to do yoga, to stop masturbating as if semen is a national resource. Meanwhile my actual lived reality is that I’m sitting in a bathroom that smells faintly of damp cement and old disinfectant, staring at a dump that looks like it should have its own police escort, and my dick is doing that pathetic thing it does now where it sometimes wakes up late, like a lazy employee who still expects a promotion.

Here’s the part that makes me hate myself: the moment the turd hit the water, my brain did a weird pivot toward erotic shame, because of course it did, because my mind is a filthy little courtroom where every charge is read aloud. I thought of porn—not the fun, glossy fantasy version, but the exhausted, compulsive, “I’m just going to watch for five minutes” version that turns into an hour of clicking and sinking and then a sad, sticky orgasm that feels like paying a fine. Porn has this talent for making you feel both overstimulated and dead, like you’ve been shouted at by images. And then you’re left with the same body, the same loneliness, and now apparently a turd the size of a sacred pillar.

Sex at fifty is not a celebration; it’s a negotiation with decay. When I was younger, desire felt like a fire. Now it feels like an old ceiling fan that sometimes starts, sometimes squeals, sometimes stops for no reason, and you’re sitting there in the heat, sweating, waiting for airflow that may never come. I’ve had erections that were more apology than arousal. I’ve had fantasies that were basically nostalgia with tits. I’ve had those humiliating mornings where you wake up half-hard from a dream you can’t even remember, and the second you become conscious—poof—the cock retreats like a scared turtle, because even my penis has an anxiety disorder.

And somehow, staring at my own shit, I thought: this is my masculinity now. Not some heroic spear, not some proud Bengali virility myth, but a weak, inconsistent organ paired with an overachieving intestine. My dick is a disappointed intern. My colon is the CEO.

Then the politics arrived, because politics always arrives, like a neighbor with loud opinions and no sense of time. The holy cow. The sacred dung. The national obsession with purity that somehow coexists with filth in every street corner. We worship the cow, we protect the cow, we weaponize the cow, and meanwhile the rest of us are just walking digestive tracts trying to find a clean public toilet, which is like trying to find an honest press conference. I have watched men scream about culture and tradition while standing next to a wall painted with spit and piss. I have watched “spiritual” people throw plastic into rivers and then pray. I have watched politicians wrap themselves in religion the way my turd wrapped itself in my dignity: tightly, smugly, without asking permission.

Colonial history even has a cameo here, because of course it does. The British came with their ideas of sanitation and order, and they left behind a bureaucracy that can file a form about your death but can’t build a toilet that doesn’t feel like a hostage situation. They taught us to be ashamed of our bodies while also refusing to properly manage them. They made “civilization” into a costume. And now I’m here, an English-medium education trapped inside an Indian plumbing reality, contemplating a turd that feels like a referendum on empire.

If you want an abstract metaphor, here: my dump was like democracy in this country—too big, too stubborn, impossible to flush cleanly, and everyone pretending it’s holy while it stinks.

I tried to flush. The water rose. It hesitated. It made a sound like an old man sighing. It did not take the offering. It did not accept my sacrament. It looked at me, the way the universe looks at me, and said: “No.”

So now I’m sweating in winter, which is a special kind of insult, because sweat in January feels like your body has misunderstood the assignment. I’m half-panicking, half-laughing, because the absurdity is perfect: I am a man with books, with degrees, with opinions about the decline of institutions, and I cannot defeat one turd. The toilet brush sits there like a pathetic weapon. The bucket is there, like a reminder that modernity is optional. I consider, briefly, the humiliating physics of breaking it up, like some disgusting archaeologist chipping away at a fossil of my own making.

And I’m thinking of my childhood in North Calcutta, the old houses with their damp walls and their echoing courtyards, the smell of cooking oil and sewage mixing in summer, the way older relatives spoke about bodies in coded language, as if acknowledging an asshole would cause the roof to collapse. We grew up in a culture where sex was both everywhere and nowhere, where shame was the default flavor, where you learned to be horny in secret and then to hate yourself for it, where you could recite poems but couldn’t ask for condoms without feeling like you’d committed treason. Now I’m older, and the shame has simply gotten new furniture. It’s moved from the bedroom to the bathroom.

I finally managed it, in the most undignified way possible, with water and brute force and a kind of resigned profanity that felt like prayer. The turd broke apart like a failed ideology, pieces drifting, surrendering, and the bowl emptied with a reluctant gulp, as if it too was embarrassed to be associated with me. The room smelled like victory and defeat at the same time, which is basically my entire life.

I washed my hands too long, because when you can’t cleanse the mind, you scrub the skin. I looked in the mirror, and the face looking back had that familiar expression: tired, annoyed, faintly amused, the eyes of a man who wants tenderness but keeps choosing isolation because it feels safer to be a cunt to himself than to risk being a cunt to someone else and losing them.

Then, because I’m a genius, I opened my phone, and within five minutes I was watching porn again, not even hard, just… dutifully curious, like an idiot reading the same depressing news every day, and my dick responded with the faintest twitch, like it was shrugging, and I thought: holy cow, holy turd, holy nothing—this is the whole religion, isn’t it, body to shame to rinse to repeat, and somewhere outside, in the winter air that carries every sound, a neighbor’s TV blared in surround sound, and I sat there soft and annoyed and oddly grateful that at least the toilet, for once, had taken something from me.
