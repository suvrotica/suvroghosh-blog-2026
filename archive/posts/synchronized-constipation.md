Try as we might, no amount of synchronized ass-clenching, grimacing, or existential constipation has ever convinced humanity to shit simultaneously. Nope, we're hopelessly unsynchronized in all things—happiness, sadness, bowel movements, even the damned philosophical profundities we crap out at 3 a.m. after too much chili vodka. You see, while some schmuck in Brussels may be wiping his ass clean with a monogrammed silk tissue at the zenith of his morning glory, a hapless Calcutta sucker (yours truly) is clenching tighter than Scrooge's purse strings, choking on the constipated misery of unfulfilled dreams and partially digested lentils.

Think about it (or don’t—what’s it to me?): When Socrates waxed philosophical, downing hemlock shots like a cocky college kid challenging mortality to beer pong, somewhere a Neanderthal ancestor was probably crouched behind a rock, furrowing a low unibrow, trying to decipher why eating berries made the back exit so goddamned fiery. Wisdom and diarrhea, my friends, have always marched side by side, like obnoxious Siamese twins joined at the sphincter.

This cosmic unsynchronization—this unfathomably irritating reality that not everyone is blissfully orgasmic or abjectly depressed at precisely the same nanosecond—is life's greatest punchline and cruelest hemorrhoid rolled into one grotesque paradox. And yet, like pathetic monkeys we clap, clap, clap our fleshy paws together, pretending society is a grand unified ballet of coordinated assholes. Bollocks. Pure, unmitigated bollocks. Life's not a choreographed dance; it's an epileptic seizure in a porcelain shop—bulls and china and shards everywhere.


Consider happiness: elusive, slippery, insidious, like that one fart you gamble won't come loaded (and tragically discover it did). Happiness—from "hap," Old Norse for "luck" or "chance"—literally screams, "Dude, don't count on me! I'm the cosmic fart that sometimes comes clean, sometimes soils your Armani briefs!" And misery—oh misery—the magnificent perennial hemorrhoid, derived from Latin "miser," meaning wretched. Wretched—now there’s a word as poetically satisfying as it is physically accurate.

But we persist, humanity does, in forcing fake synchronicity. Holidays and mandatory joyous celebrations punctuate the calendar, marking enforced smiles and pre-scheduled happiness, social enemas violently administered to cleanse us of reality's grim residue. "Be happy! Eat cake!" bellows society; "Now feel sad, dammit!" commands tragedy. What if I’m busy? What if I feel like shitting right now instead of celebrating your goddamn wedding vows or birthday cake or funeral tears? I want freedom—no, I demand freedom—to be sad, euphoric, existentially panicked, or explosively diarrheal when the whim overtakes me.

And let’s face it: history has proved time and again that the monumental endeavors of mankind—the pyramids, calculus, the Sistine Chapel—are merely grandiose attempts at distracting ourselves from our humiliating inability to synchronize even the most basic bodily functions. You think Michelangelo painted God touching Adam’s limp digit out of some divine inspiration? Bullshit. He was compensating, folks—overcompensating for the grotesque, humiliating, unsynchronized reality of his own digestive tract. Renaissance humanism? Merely desperate cultural constipation.

So next time you witness humanity's tragicomic inability to collectively experience any goddamned emotion or bodily function simultaneously—be it the orgasmic cheer of World Cup goals or the unified horror at election results—just remember: we're all alone, grotesquely unsynchronized, and perpetually shitting our pants at our own individual pace. And perhaps, just perhaps, that's the true glory of the human condition—billions of assholes marching resolutely out of sync, toward no goal, to no rhythm, desperately clinging to the toilet paper roll of life that never quite tears where it should.
