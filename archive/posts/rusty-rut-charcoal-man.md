The gas arrives before the thought, a sly internal cough, a pressure wave sneaking up like a bad idea you didn’t invite but which has already taken its shoes off and is now sitting on your chest, and I’m bent over the commode—plastic, cracked, loyal in the way only cheap things are—wondering if the rumor about methane and ignition is a scientific curiosity or a practical skill I should have learned earlier, because the body at fifty doesn’t negotiate, it announces, and it announces loudly, with a smell that suggests a small animal has died inside a philosophy book and is now rotting on page three hundred where the optimism used to be.

I move like an exhibit, a slow diorama of inertia, mattress on the floor to commode and back again, a pilgrim on a sacred route that smells faintly of disinfectant and old rice water, and the idea that I’d never achieve anything worth achieving anything again doesn’t arrive as despair exactly, more like a weather report delivered by a bored announcer, rust everywhere, deceleration uphill, gravity with a smug grin, and the mind, which once sprinted, now shuffles in boxers that have given up on elastic the way I’ve given up on verbs that suggest progress.

Charcoal is the right metaphor because charcoal understands pressure and heat and still ends up as smudge, a ruin rendered lovingly, every line darker where the hand pressed too hard, and I press hard because I’m tired of pretending there’s a light touch left in me, the sketch of a man stalled against an upslope while the supply chain of youth keeps arriving—sleeker, less talkative, better-looking, less invested in complaining as an art form—except even they are fucked because the bots have learned to smile without lips and write without hands and optimize without pity, and somewhere a server farm hums like a god with no face, eating everyone’s lunch and then billing them for the napkin.

Tea happens twice a day because ritual is cheaper than therapy, because boiling water is the closest I come to command, because the mute pan hisses like it wants to tell me a secret but can’t be bothered, and the leaves unfurl with colonial obedience, brown surrender in a swirl, the chemistry of extraction doing what it has always done, diffusion across a gradient, entropy with manners, and I drink it too hot because pain is proof of presence, because the tongue blister is a tiny flag planted on a conquered morning.

Rice scrapes by. Literally scrapes. The pot whispers when it’s done, starch clinging like a grudge, and I count grains the way some people count blessings, with suspicion and a calculator, enough to eat, enough to pay the shanty lifestyle rent, enough to keep the books stacked like a fort against the night, spines cracked, margins polluted with notes from a younger man who thought annotation was a ladder and not a moat.

I was trained to solve problems with edges and vertices, to believe in clean constraints and solvable systems, but the body laughs at that formalism and produces gas you could almost light on fire, ay caramba, and that’s not metaphor, that’s physics flirting with arson, the flammable output of a digestive tract that has decided to freelance, and the mind follows suit, producing thoughts that combust on contact with reality, brief, bright, useless.

Porn arrives early in the month like a budget item with a sense of humor, data plan splurged, pixels rented, bodies performing a geometry I once studied abstractly—angles, intersections, friction coefficients—now reduced to a wrist ache and a shame hangover that tastes like cheap soap, and the horniness isn’t romance, it’s plumbing, a pressure relief valve, a reminder that the endocrine system hasn’t received the memo about retirement, that hormones don’t read essays or respect despair, they just knock, repeatedly, until you answer or they start kicking.

Science says aging is accumulation of damage, stochastic insults to molecules that never get repaired quite right, telomeres fraying like the hems of my boxers, mitochondria wheezing, the power plants of the cell unionizing against me, and I nod along because it’s nice when a theory agrees with your lived experience, when entropy feels seen, when the second law pats you on the back and says yes, you’re doing it right, everything falls apart, even the excuses.

Politics drips in through the cracks, a dampness you can’t paint over, slogans pasted on the walls of the mind like peeling posters, promises with expiration dates written in invisible ink, and nationalism smells like reheated leftovers, all spice and no nutrition, masculinity like a gym locker that never gets cleaned, spirituality like incense trying to hide mold, and I’m numb enough to find the humor but not numb enough to avoid the rash.

Colonial history sits in the cupboard with the rice, measuring cups inherited along with the language I curse in, the metric system of shame and aspiration, the idea that progress comes from elsewhere and arrives late, taxed, and broken, and I laugh because the laugh is cheaper than the scream, because laughter is just air escaping with better timing.

Books promise escape and deliver paper cuts. They tell me about men who did things, women who endured things, equations that held, revolutions that mattered, and I underline passages as if ink could slow time, as if footnotes were tourniquets, and the body interrupts with a fart that could strip paint, a reminder that abstraction always leaks, that the real is viscous and smelly and will not be footnoted away.

The mattress remembers everything. It keeps the shape of my spine like a bad memory, a topography of stalled nights, and when I roll over it sighs, springs negotiating their own ceasefire, and the ceiling fan counts time with a wobble that suggests it, too, is tired of spinning for nothing, tired of the same four corners, tired of the promise that tomorrow will be different if you just believe hard enough.

AI is the new weather, they say, and I check the forecast with a grimace, automation with a smile, optimization with a knife, and I imagine the bots reading this and nodding, generating a better version of my bitterness in half the time, monetizing my despair with better kerning, and the joke lands because it hurts, because the future has learned my tricks and does them cleaner.

Sometimes I try to walk it off, pacing the room like a thought trapped in a skull, counting steps, counting breaths, counting the reasons not to set anything on fire, and the body rewards me with another announcement, a trumpet blast from the gut, a comic punctuation mark, and I think about ignition again, about how energy wants out, how release is inevitable, how even decay produces heat.

There’s tenderness in odd places, like the way the tea stains the cup just so, like the way a sentence can still surprise me, like the way a fart can be both disgusting and impressive, a minor feat of chemistry performed without applause, and I hold onto that not as hope, which is a con, but as data, an observation logged without comment.

Night arrives without ceremony. The books loom. The data plan ticks down. The body queues its complaints for morning. I lie there listening to my own digestion conduct a small orchestra, bass and brass, imagining the spark, imagining the light, then deciding against it because the commode is plastic and I’m not in the mood to explain anything to anyone.

I fall asleep with a half-hard problem pressing against the boxers, not desire exactly, more like habit, and the last thing I think before the fan clicks off is that if this is the plateau, it’s a funny one, a flat place that smells like tea and rice and the faint promise of combustion, and somewhere inside me a tiny pilot light flickers, bored, waiting, mercifully unlit.
