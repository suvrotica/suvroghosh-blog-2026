It started with a tight, puckered sphincter and a fucking Casio calculator.

I was sitting on my plastic toilet seat—which has developed this charming hairline crack that pinches my left ass cheek exactly where the soul used to live—and I was trying, for the sixth time that week, to take a dump. Nothing. Just hot, gassy whispers and the feeling that some cosmic bureaucrat had misplaced my bowel movement authorization form.

But what came out instead, crouched between constipation and the last crusted drop of the morning’s reheated dal, was a *number*. 4.6692. Over and over again, like one of those annoying mnemonic jingles that hooks itself into the folds of your brain meat and wriggles like a parasitic centipede—you try to forget, and it humps your hippocampus harder.

The Feigenbaum constant. Yes, that one. That unreasonably sexy bastard of a number. The mathematical equivalent of a prostitute whispering “I know your mother’s name” as she jerks you off in the dark.



They say the Feigenbaum constant is what shows up when orderly systems—dripping with rules, wearing crisp Newtonian underpants—start to go all slutty and chaotic. You take a simple function, a logistic map maybe, population growth or rabbit-fucking-rate or whatever, and you tweak a single parameter—just a little—just the tip—and suddenly bifurcations happen. One becomes two. Two becomes four. Four becomes fuck-you-too-many. And right at the edge of all this whorehouse mathematics, as the system slips into chaos, *that* number appears like a math demon in a cum-stained trenchcoat: **4.6692...**

Not three, not pi, not golden anything. But a constant that says: you push nature, she pushes back, and then, without warning, she queefs in your face and eats your calculator.



Now, I learned about it on page 231 of a secondhand paperback that smelled like ball sweat and coconut hair oil, sitting in a room too close to the bathroom, too far from hope. And I thought: fuck, this constant knows me. It *is* me. Every year I inch closer to total disintegration—first doubling in my joblessness, then in bitterness, then in neck fat, then in visible regret—and each stage feels exactly 4.6692 times closer to the inevitable shit-smeared abyss.

The bifurcation diagram looks like my life if you squint: symmetrical, sprouting alternate realities, each one shittier than the last. One branch where I stayed in Austin and drank myself into an amicable suicide pact with a bottle of Jack. One where I became a professor with a limp dick and a secret OnlyFans subscription. One where I stayed here, right here, constipated on a cracked toilet, discovering Feigenbaum in my farts.



Mitchell Feigenbaum, the guy, was a chain-smoking, disheveled physics prodigy who basically jerked off into a TI-83 and made love to chaos theory in a back alley of Los Alamos. He didn’t believe in smoothness. He saw the universe as a series of ugly, kinky hiccups. And he realized that even *mess* has a goddamn pattern.

And that’s where I spiraled, again. See, I don’t trust patterns. Not anymore.

Because when you’re Bengali and 50-something and your body smells like an old bookstore had sex with a fish market, and your phone has 47 unread messages but none of them are from a woman or a bank or even the water guy—it’s hard to believe in elegant recurrence. You see stuttered chaos not as beauty but as… routine. The failed job applications. The creeping mold. The political slogans. The price of onions. The sudden erections at the wrong time (never the right time). You start to think: maybe this isn’t a phase transition. Maybe it’s just a prolonged fungal infection of reality.



There’s a famous diagram from his work—it starts with one branch, then splits, then splits again, and the gaps get smaller and smaller and it looks like a beautiful tree if the tree had been dipped in ketamine and electrocuted. And every time you zoom in, expecting resolution, you just find more mess. That’s what chaos does. It doesn’t give you clarity. It gives you *structureless recursion*, the mathematical equivalent of trying to explain your life to an ex-girlfriend while sobbing into the kitchen sink and holding a spoon full of Horlicks.

But hey, look, science! Isn’t it amazing? You know what else has a bifurcation pattern? A prolapsed anus. Look it up.



Feigenbaum’s number doesn’t come from the sky. It emerges. From a dumb, iterative system. f(x) = r * x * (1 - x). The kind of equation that should be boring. Like your uncle’s erectile dysfunction diagnosis. But no—tweak the parameter *r*, and at certain values, the system flips out like a drunk aunt at a wedding, and you go from calm to threesomes to murder in like six cycles.

The universe *wants* to be chaotic. But it’s too ashamed to admit it. So it invents constants to whisper between the screams.



I once had a dream (induced, no doubt, by an overdose of calcium supplements and post-midnight YouTube playlists involving string theory and Sri Lankan cooking) that I met Feigenbaum. He was barefoot. He told me chaos is just the body’s way of remembering it’s meat.

And then he farted.

I woke up sweating and still couldn’t shit.



Every time I look at that constant now, it feels like a middle finger from the cosmos. Like it’s telling me: hey, motherfucker, all that effort you made to stay rational? To make lists? To “reinvent” yourself with ten minutes of yoga and a new Google Doc called *Vision 2035*? *Too late.* You’re past the bifurcation point. You're on the outer branches now. You can't even fold your underwear without triggering a recursive breakdown of linear causality.

There’s no going back to “one.”



I have a theory.

Maybe God isn’t a bearded man or a particle or a moral fable or some simulated quantum server in West Fuckall Oregon. Maybe God is a bum-fucking constant. A number that reminds you the moment things seem regular, they’re just gearing up to split, crack, fork, and fail, again and again, until all you can do is stand at the bottom of your own life chart, staring up at the infinite branching of decisions you didn’t make, dicks you didn’t suck, degrees you didn’t finish, friends you didn’t keep, toilets you didn’t clean.



There is no stable attractor here.

Only mess. Only the constant. Only 4.6692, repeating forever.

Like that itch I have on the underside of my left nut that no doctor believes is real.
