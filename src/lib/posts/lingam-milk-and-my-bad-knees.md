The milk hits the stone with a sound that isn’t a sound so much as a wet little agreement, a soft slap that says yes, yes, yes, this is what we came for, and the lingam sits there in its oiled black dignity—half polished by centuries of hands, half slick from yesterday’s leftovers—while the priest’s wrist performs the same circular motion my own life has been doing for fifty years: revolve, repeat, pretend it’s a new orbit.

It’s cold in the temple in that damp winter way Calcutta has, where the air itself feels like it’s been stored in a fridge next to a bowl of old fish curry, and my knees creak when I squat, and my stomach does that sour, theatrical gurgle like a bad tabla player warming up, and I can smell everything at once: incense, sweat, camphor, cheap perfume, wet stone, and the faint ghost of piss that all holy places have, because humans are humans and holiness is mostly a signage problem.

A woman in a red-and-white sari leans forward with her steel lota, and the milk arcs out with devotional confidence, and it lands right on the rounded top, and for a second my brain—traitorous, overeducated, porn-poisoned, too fond of biology—does the obvious translation: that’s a penis, madam, you are pouring milk on a penis, a sacred penis, a cosmic penis, the penis of the god whose whole brand is raw power and destruction and untidy appetite, and you’re doing it with the tender seriousness of someone watering a tulsi plant.

And then, because my mind is a fucking sewer with a library card, it adds: not just any penis, but the politely abstracted kind, the kind your aunties can look at without blushing because everyone has agreed to call it “symbol,” like calling a fart “wind” so the room doesn’t have to acknowledge what just happened.

I’m standing there with my hands half-folded, half-itching, watching the milk run down the stone in white rivulets, pooling at the base where flowers and ash and old streaks of vermillion cling like the last patients in a government hospital corridor, and I’m thinking about how symbolism works, how it’s basically compression—like zipping a messy folder of human hunger into a neat icon you can carry around without spilling your shame all over the bus.

Because if you don’t compress it, if you keep it unzipped, you get the actual thing: bodies, heat, smells, fluids, clumsy desire, the sweaty panic of wanting someone who doesn’t want you back, the nightly humiliation of your own hand, the morning regret that tastes like metal, the whole undignified circus. Religion, in this sense, is a brilliant piece of engineering. It takes the unpresentable and gives it a dress code.

Nobody tells you this when you’re a boy in North Calcutta, when you’re made to stand in line with your mother while she says “pronam” and you copy her like a little monkey with good manners, and you stare at the stone and feel nothing except boredom and the itch of your own underwear elastic. Nobody says: listen, kid, this is a way we talk about sex without saying sex, this is how we keep the village from collapsing into a horny riot, this is how we get women to perform reverence at the altar of male power and call it spirituality, and this is also—because humans are complicated and never satisfied with one meaning—how we sneak in a kind of equal-opportunity awe at the brute fact of creation.

Instead they tell you it’s “Shiva,” as if that explains anything, as if naming a mystery is solving it, like putting a label on a jar of termites.

The women don’t look like they’re thinking “penis.” They look like they’re thinking “blessing.” They look like they’re thinking “my husband’s health,” “my child’s exam,” “my mother-in-law’s blood pressure,” “please let the landlord not raise rent,” “please let the bus not kill me today.” Practical prayers. Low-budget metaphysics. And I, the bitter atheist with the malfunctioning plumbing, am the one standing there feeling scandalized, as if my own head isn’t full of far filthier images than a smooth stone receiving milk in public.

This is the part where the rationalist in me tries to be noble, tries to say, don’t be a cunt, let people have their rituals, they are coping mechanisms, we are all just apes with anxiety. The rationalist then slips on a banana peel made of hypocrisy and falls face-first into the truth: I am not scandalized by them; I am scandalized by myself, by the way my mind can’t see a symbol without dragging it back into flesh.

And flesh is where I am losing the war.

At fifty-something the body stops being a home and becomes a hostile bureaucracy. You file a request for a decent night’s sleep and the department says, sorry, backlog, maybe next quarter. You apply for a reliable erection—nothing heroic, just a functional piece of equipment, like a ceiling fan that doesn’t wobble—and the clerk looks at you over his glasses and says, “Try again after reducing stress,” which is like telling a man in a burning building to “relax.” Meanwhile your gut runs its own political party, issuing surprise elections at the worst possible time, and your sweat glands behave like they’re paid per litre, and your skin develops its own geography of rashes and small humiliations.

So yes, I stand in a Shaivite temple and think about the penis, because my own body is a constant reminder of how much of life is plumbing and electricity, and how little of it is poetry, no matter how many fucking books you read.

The milk keeps flowing. Someone offers me a spoonful of charanamrit—sweet, diluted, the sugar trying desperately to convince you it’s sanctified and not just sticky water—and I take it because refusing would start a small war, and I don’t have the energy for wars anymore, not even the fun ones. The spoon touches my tongue and my mind, which is always eager to be disgusting, imagines the day’s trajectory of that milk: poured, warmed, blessed, sipped, swallowed, absorbed, and eventually—let’s not be coy—shat out tomorrow morning in a different form, because the cosmos is a recycling plant and we are its embarrassed workers.

Somewhere in that cycle is an abstract thought: ideology is like digestion. You take in stories and slogans and you break them down, and you keep the nutrients—meaning, belonging, a sense of control—and you excrete the rest. The problem is that in this country we have a lot of people proudly eating plastic and calling it prasad, then acting shocked when their politics comes out as toxic sludge.

And the temple, which should have been a place to acknowledge raw human energy—sex, death, fear, power—has become, like everything else, a stage for performance. Even the atheists perform. I perform my contempt. I perform my distance. I perform my little educated sneer. Inside, I’m a trembling sack of needs like everyone else, but with worse posture.

Colonial history does this to you too. It teaches you shame in English, which is a very efficient language for shame because it comes with paperwork. The British didn’t invent our guilt, obviously—Indians have been inventing guilt since before it was fashionable—but they gave it a modern corporate sheen. Now you can be ashamed of your desire while also being ashamed of being ashamed, like a two-tier tax system.

And then, in a delicious twist of irony, the same people who claim to be guardians of “our culture” will clutch their pearls at the mention of sex, while praying to a god whose most iconic object is, again, a stylized cock on a pedestal. It’s like running an anti-alcohol campaign from inside a pub.

Somewhere behind me a man clears his throat loudly, the universal sound of male entitlement, and I shift aside because my spine has learned submission, not to gods but to crowds. My shoulder brushes someone’s arm, and the contact sends a tiny, stupid electric message through my skin, the kind that used to mean something when I was young and full of animal optimism, before life taught me that longing is a self-renewing subscription service you never asked for.

For a second—just a second—my mind does what it always does: it tries to turn that spark into a fantasy, something soft and impossible and humiliating, because fantasy is cheaper than reality and doesn’t require you to fix your teeth or your bank account or your personality. Then the fantasy collapses under its own weight, because the body is not cooperating, the years are heavy, and my self-respect is a thin, moth-eaten shawl that doesn’t cover anything important.

The priest rings a bell. The bell says: pay attention, be present, stop thinking, surrender. My stomach answers with a different bell, a gurgle that says: find a toilet, you idiot, the gods can wait.

And that’s the punchline of my life, really. Not grand tragedy. Not noble suffering. Just the constant negotiation between metaphysics and mucus.

Outside the temple the winter sun is weak, like a cheap LED, and the street smells of exhaust and frying oil and old dust. A bus honks like it’s angry at the concept of existence. I walk carefully because my knees are traitors, and because my mind, still stuck on the lingam, keeps replaying the white milk sliding over black stone, and how everyone around it can treat it as pure devotion while I can’t stop seeing the dirty human engine underneath.

Maybe they’re healthier than me. Maybe they’re smarter. Maybe ignorance is a kind of mercy. Or maybe they know perfectly well and the whole point is that they know, and they choose, collectively, to look straight at it and not flinch, while I, the sophisticated asshole, flinch at everything—including myself.

At the corner tea stall I buy a paper cup of tea that tastes like boiled impatience. The first sip hits my gut and the gut sends a memo: emergency meeting. I start walking faster, which at my age is less “urgent” and more “comedy,” a man trying to hurry while his joints negotiate every step like unionized workers.

A girl in a sweater passes by, laughing at something on her phone, and my eyes betray me for half a second, and my heart does the old foolish twitch, and then my body, that unreliable collaborator, responds with a faint stirring of interest that is immediately drowned by the much louder and more authoritative signal: you are going to shit yourself if you don’t get home in five minutes.

So yes. Shiva’s cosmic sexual energy. Raw creation. The universe’s thrust and pulse. The eternal lingam bathed in milk.

And me, waddling home with a clenched asshole, trying to hide a ridiculous, half-hearted hard-on from nobody in particular, because even my defeats can’t coordinate properly.
