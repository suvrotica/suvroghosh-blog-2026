It begins with me on the toilet, of course, where all democracy ends up anyway. A dry, constipated morning shit that refuses to come out like it’s negotiating a Rajya Sabha seat—bloated, theatrical, and stinking of dead promises. I’m hunched on the commode, bare-assed, boxer elastic digging into my thigh like the Indian Penal Code into free speech, sweating from the back of my neck like a brown bureaucrat’s taint on election day. My tea has gone cold. My intestines, however, have not. They’ve gone full Bhagat Singh: rebellious, noisy, and mostly misunderstood.

And in that exquisite moment of anal indecision, somewhere between a fart and a prayer, it hit me like a lathi charge in my colon: we are not citizens. We are prostate-massaging suck-holes with opinions so limp, so fungus-covered, they make a flaccid dick in a sauna look assertive. We don’t vote. We don’t revolt. We fucking *worship*. Our ballots are just fetish objects shoved lovingly into the ballot box's tight little democratic hole, praying it moans back development.

You see a man in power and your first instinct, whether you're a chaiwala in Begusarai or a CXO doing yoga with a soft-on in Powai, is not to ask "What are you doing for me?"—it is to *fucking bow*, mentally suck that man’s chappal till the rubber patterns are tattooed on your tongue, and then giggle as he steps on your nuts with the other foot. We are a nation of givers, alright. Givers of rim jobs.

Every Bengali I know becomes a revolutionary only while drunk or post-defecation. In both states the body is relaxed and philosophical. But never while queuing outside a ration shop in forty-three degrees, or when that asswipe MP shows up grinning like a goat with a hard-on. Then everyone claps. Women ululate. Men raise hands. Children piss themselves with joy. Someone faints. And the actual public toilet, which smells like Gandhi’s broken dreams and cheap phenyl, remains locked. Because why not. The VIP is here. Time to suck dick and forget you're poor.

It’s not that our leaders are bad. No. That would be manageable. I can understand bad. What we have are *useless*, *shameless*, *oil-slicked motherfuckers* whose primary skill is staying unpunished. They are gristle. They are the burnt bits of rice stuck at the bottom of the degchi of democracy. And we, we are licking that degchi clean, tongue first, eyes wide, like it’s goddamn prasad.

In science terms, the Indian electorate behaves like colon bacteria: mindless, clumpy, and thriving best in darkness. Feed it sugar-coated lies, watch it ferment, then wait for it to explode in a gaseous burst of temple-building, WhatsApp farts, and barefoot pilgrimages to the nearest scam.

Oh and education doesn’t help. In fact, it makes it worse. The PhDs and IITians I’ve met in my sagging, saggy life are more likely to quote Chanakya and share Adani memes than ask "Where the fuck did my taxes go?" If they do ask, it’s only rhetorically—because they still think GST is a protein supplement. Most Indian engineers have the moral courage of a fungus and the spine of a used condom. If nationalism gave them a boner, they’d fuck the map.

Let me put it in digestive terms. You’re at the mercy of a body that doesn’t always obey. Some days it's diarrhea, other days it’s nothing but wind and shame. Governance is the same. You expect firm delivery, strong fibre, clean exit—but what you get is constipation with sideburns, wrapped in saffron or starched white or whatever new shade of fecal you’re currently worshipping.

Democracy should be about control. Choice. Participatory poop, if you will. But ours is a sort of reverse enema, where the leaders squat above us, dump policies, and we take it with prayer hands and a Facebook reel.

And don’t give me that tired-ass excuse about colonial trauma. Yes, we were ruled. Yes, they starved us. Yes, they drew borders with dick-shaped pens while smoking cigars rolled with our future. But that ended. At least on paper. Now? Now we volunteer for the same spanking, bend over in HD, and share it proudly on social media with hashtags like #FeelingBlessed and #ModijiKiLeela.

You want progress? Stop voting with your rectum. Use your fucking brain. Demand things. Ask for drainage systems that don’t breed dengue. Ask for hospitals where the doctor doesn’t smell like despair and expired Dettol. Ask for air you don’t have to chew.

Ask for *work*, not words. And if the fucker in charge doesn’t deliver, *stop clapping* and start spitting. You’re not a cheerleader. You’re a goddamn taxpaying meat sack. Act like it.

But no. Instead, what do we do?

We decorate the very arsehole that shits on us.

We call it culture.

We light a diya next to it.

We name our kids after it.

We call it “bhaavnaa” when we mean brain-rot.

We smear cow piss on our face and chant GDP figures like a cult that forgot it’s broke.

I went to get groceries yesterday, and the man at the counter had a massive poster of that dead-eyed fuckhead MLA right behind his head like a pimple saint halo. I asked him, "Why do you have this here?" and he said, I swear to Kali, “Dada, shomporko bhalo rakhte hobe. Ki jani kon dine ki lagte pare.”

Translation: keep the rat happy. Who knows when you’ll need his teeth.

That, right there, is India.

A thousand years of rat diplomacy. Waving at the boot that steps on your face because, hey, maybe tomorrow, it’ll step on your neighbour instead and give you a ministerial blowjob while you wait for onions to reach a price you can pronounce without crying.

I didn’t shit that morning. The feeling passed. Like freedom. And maybe, just maybe, deep down in our national gut—which, mind you, is already bloated with bad dal, caste guilt, and three centuries of colonial IBS—we *like* the smell of arbitrary power, we *like* watching the fucker on top wave his dick around like a flaming sword of apathy, because it grants us, the ass-scratching plebs, the divine right to be lazy, petty, conniving little turds in our own shitty spheres—skip the line, bribe the clerk, ignore the law, slap a junior, dump garbage where grandma prays, half-ass the project, ghost the client, and call it jugaad. It's a fucked barter economy of corruption and indifference: you let them shit on you from above, and in return you get to shit on someone smaller. That’s the real democracy here. Not one man one vote. One turd, many toilets. No matter what flag you raise or anthem you belch, the fruit this democracy bears will always come from the same sack of decomposing, gas-bloated, maggot-slicked fuckfruit we’ve been hoarding in the name of tradition, pride, or just the comforting weight of rot.
