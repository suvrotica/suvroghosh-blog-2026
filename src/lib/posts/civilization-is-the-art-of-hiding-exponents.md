The QR code on the counter has a small tear through its left edge, like a paper cut in the face of modernity, and I’m standing there with my phone held at an angle that makes me look either devotional or faintly criminal—light hits the screen, the camera refuses to focus, the shopkeeper watches me with the patient contempt of a man who has seen literacy fail in many forms, and behind me a teenager is doing the same payment in one effortless thumb-flick, as if money has always been a polite beam of light that travels through the air when summoned.

The payment goes through.

A tiny green tick.

The universe says: done.

This, apparently, is what we have built civilization for: the green tick. The green tick is O(1). The green tick is the fantasy that all complicated things can be reduced to a single gesture performed by a monkey descendant with sweaty fingers and a poor relationship to passwords.

It’s not that the transaction is simple. It’s that someone has dragged the complexity into a basement and locked it there, like a disreputable relative during a wedding.

You can feel the hidden machinery if you let your mind run its obnoxious little diagnostic routine: the bank servers, the telecom towers, the electricity that depends on coal that depends on trains that depend on steel that depends on… (and somewhere, far away, a man with a helmet is chiseling rock so that I can buy a packet of biscuits without touching cash). The green tick is not truth; it’s an interface. It’s a soft, friendly UI sitting on top of a hard, indifferent system that would happily crush you if you tripped on a minor exception.

That’s the respectable version of abstraction: the honest kind, the engineering kind, the kind that makes the world livable for ordinary minds. A city is a complexity compressor. So is a hospital. So is a supermarket with its fluorescent lighting and calm aisles pretending that food comes from packaging, not from soil and blood and weather. So is the cloud, that delicious modern joke where you rent someone else’s computer and call it the sky.

I can admire this. I do admire this. I’m not one of those people who thinks complexity is evil just because it requires reading things longer than a WhatsApp message. The fact that most of us can operate in O(1) most of the time is the reason we aren’t all dead from the administrative burden of being alive. The boiler in your building works because you don’t need to understand thermodynamics every morning; you just want hot water, and you want it now, because your back hurts and your hair is doing that thing where it looks like it has political opinions.

But here’s where the Indian talent arrives, briskly, like a broker on a scooter: we don’t just build black boxes to hide complexity; we sell black boxes that *pretend complexity never existed*.

The respectable engineer hides exponents so you can function.

The streetwise charmer hides exponents so you can be fooled.

And the difference is not philosophical; it’s in the invoice.

There’s a kind of national improvisation we like to romanticize—*jugaad*, we call it, a word that has been exported with pride, as if duct tape is a moral virtue. Sometimes it is. Sometimes it’s just creativity in a scarce world. Sometimes it’s a person solving a real problem with limited tools, the way my mother would manage a feast from half a fridge and an angry stove. Fine. Humans are adaptive. We’re clever. We make do.

But there’s another cousin of *jugaad* that we don’t put in TED talks because it smells bad: the habit of taking something that is inherently O(n^2) or O(2^n) and marketing it as O(1) with a wink.

“Sir, tension mat lo. I will handle everything.”

“Only sign here.”

“Just give the advance.”

“Bas, done.”

These are not sentences. These are narcotics.

The broker who says this is selling you a fantasy interface: the *green tick of life*. It’s the idea that paperwork, permits, contracts, customs, taxes, supply chains, and the petty malice of institutions can be made to behave like an obedient app. Tap once, receive result. No queues. No documents. No consequences. *A deal.*

And the buyer—often a tired person, sometimes an honest person, sometimes me on a weak day—wants to believe it because time poverty is real and exhaustion is a kind of coercion. You don’t have the energy to understand the system, so you rent someone else’s understanding. That, by itself, is not a sin; specialists exist for a reason. The sin is when the specialist is actually a magician selling you a trick: he makes the complexity disappear by moving it into the future.

Deferred chaos. Now with EMI. 

When I came back to India, all NRI-starried and embarrassingly sincere, I was also embarrassingly ignorant of the local genius for deceit-as-service; I thought I was returning to a difficult home, not a bazaar of “trust me, sir” predators, and in my little attempts at entrepreneurship I was taken for a ride at every step—advances for everything, advances for introductions, advances for “investments” that existed only as a story, advances for contacts who turned out to be cousins of someone’s cousin with a business card and no actual business. It was all lies, mostly small lies told with big confidence, and because I was a small fish—no institutional shield, no political godfather, no family ecosystem of hardened negotiators—it didn’t just inconvenience me, it finished me: a slow financial death by a thousand polite invoices, leaving me as this dead, demented dimwit of a man who mutters invectives the way other people mutter prayers, like a chant meant not to change the world but to keep my brain from drowning in it.

I’ve watched this movie so many times I can quote the background music. The contractor promises a “simple renovation,” and then your home becomes an excavation site, dust colonizing your lungs, delays breeding like mosquitoes, each delay accompanied by a new story—some story about a supplier, a cousin, a strike, a misunderstanding, a mystical shortage of tiles that exists only on days when you ask questions. Somewhere in the middle you catch yourself thinking: I should have demanded an explicit schedule, explicit milestones, explicit penalties, like a boring person. And then you remember that in this place boring people are treated like prey.

I’m trying not to drift into the usual Calcutta lament—the honking, the corruption, the blah blah predictable misery. That’s an easy groove for my mind; it slides into it like a tram into a curve. Let’s swerve. Let’s talk about black boxes the way an engineer would, because that’s what the metaphor deserves.

In computer science, abstraction is a pact: I won’t ask what’s inside, and you won’t lie about what it does. An API is a promise. You can build skyscrapers of software because the floors below are trustworthy. The moment the promise breaks—when the “O(1)” call sometimes becomes “O(explain-yourself-to-the-police)”—the whole structure becomes a haunted house.

In India, we have abstraction without accountability. We have interfaces without guarantees. We have a civilization of *nice buttons*—forms, stamps, portals, “agents,” middlemen, and holy men—stacked on top of machinery that is not maintained, not audited, and not meant to be understood by the people it governs.

The result is a peculiar psychological economy: if you can’t make the system work, you learn to perform certainty. You learn to speak like you have a shortcut. You learn to sell an O(1) story even when you’re standing on O(n!) rubble. The seller performs competence; the buyer performs belief; the nation performs modernity.

And because deceit and duplicity have been normalized as cleverness, the performance becomes a culture, and the culture becomes destiny. You see it in small things—counterfeit shampoo, adulterated ghee, fake perfume, “original” parts that are original only in the sense that they were originally invented by a man who lies. You see it in big things too—paper compliance, box-ticking, loud inaugurations of projects that are still mostly PowerPoint.

Now religion enters, not as an exotic villain twirling a moustache, but as the oldest UI of all.

Religion—most religions, anyway—offers a metaphysical API: do this, get that. Pray, and the universe listens. Donate, and the gods keep accounts. Follow the rules, and reality becomes negotiable. The basic transaction is ancient: propitiate a certain invisible authority and your life’s complexity will be reduced.

This is not a uniquely Indian sin. This is a human feature. When you’re a frightened primate with a brain that can imagine tomorrow’s disasters, you will pay for anything that quiets the imagination. Religion is a psychological technology: it organizes groups, it provides meaning, it offers consolation, it supplies rituals that act like compression algorithms for grief. I’m not blind to its utility. I’m only allergic to its claims.

Because the metaphysical O(1) offer—“just believe,” “just surrender,” “just chant,” “just obey”—has a dark and very practical side: it trains people to accept interfaces as truth. It teaches them to treat complexity not as something to understand, but as something to outsource to authority. Sometimes that authority is a deity. Sometimes it’s a priest. Sometimes it’s a politician wearing a religious costume, which, in this country, is not even metaphor; it’s a business model.

There’s a debunked folk etymology I used to hear—someone would say “religion” comes from “re-joining,” like the soul is a USB cable trying to reconnect with God. It’s charming nonsense (the Latin debates are messy, and the tidy story is mostly wishful), but the fantasy reveals the psychological hunger: connect to the cosmic router, get better bandwidth, reduce latency, avoid packet loss in the soul. A green tick from the heavens.

My rationalist brain wants to shout: reality is not a customer service center. The universe does not have a complaint desk. Pain does not care if you’ve done your puja correctly. Cancer does not check your caste certificate. Floods are not moral arguments. They are fluid dynamics and bad planning and climate chaos and, occasionally, the historic genius of building expensive housing where water naturally wants to go.

And yet—I can’t pretend I don’t understand why the religious interface persists. Complexity is exhausting. Human life is full of variables you cannot control. Anyone who offers you a smaller equation is offering relief. A simplified model is not always a lie; it’s sometimes a necessity. You can’t carry the whole universe in your skull; you have groceries to buy and knees that complain.

The question, then, is not whether we use simplifications. We must. The question is whether the simplification is honest about what it hides.

A good abstraction says: “Here’s a handle. You can lift the heavy thing without seeing all its parts. But if the handle breaks, you can inspect it, repair it, and hold someone responsible.”

A bad abstraction says: “There is no heavy thing. Only handle. Only faith.”

India—this modern, ancient, slapstick civilization—has become expert at the bad version. We wrap complexity in ceremony. We add stamps. We add slogans. We add gods. We add national hymns and corporate decks and committees and inaugurations. We pour a little sanctity over broken plumbing and call it development. We build a whole priesthood of intermediaries—some in saffron, some in suits—whose job is to translate the system to you while making sure you never learn the language yourself.

I keep circling back to that green tick on my screen. It felt so clean. It felt so un-Indian, almost. The transaction happened, and no one asked me for a photocopy of my own face, no one demanded a “processing fee,” no one told me to come back after lunch. A small miracle. A quiet victory for the honest black box.

But even that has its shadow, doesn’t it. The very convenience that makes the system humane also makes it easy to hide rot. When everything is one tap, you stop asking what it costs. Not rupees—exponents. You stop seeing the structure. You stop noticing the power lines, the server farms, the workers, the minerals. You stop noticing who is squeezed and who is insulated. O(1) comfort is a kind of anesthesia, and anesthesia is lovely until someone is operating on the wrong limb.

My own life, I realize, has been a long argument with shortcuts. I wanted clean equations. I wanted fair systems. I wanted institutions that behaved like mathematics—transparent, consistent, not bribable. Instead I got this: a place where people often treat rules as optional and morality as negotiable, and where the loudest claims of simplicity are usually the ones hiding the nastiest exponent. And yet I’m still here, still paying with my phone, still hoping for honest interfaces, still muttering *dhur* under my breath when the world tries to sell me magic. 

And now we’re being offered the most seductive O(1) of all: let the machine do the thinking, outsource the tedious parts of cognition the way we outsourced remembering phone numbers, directions, and—if we’re honest—other people’s birthdays; it’s wonderful, genuinely, like indoor plumbing for the mind, except indoor plumbing still requires you to know what water is, and this new plumbing has a dark little failure mode where the user forgets what thinking even feels like. I’m Generation X; as a child I didn’t have a choice—I had to learn to think because boredom was mandatory and ignorance was expensive, and maybe I was always destined to become this middle-class, middle-aged no-one ninny nonentity with books (the kind of man who can name five dead French philosophers yet can’t fix a dripping tap), but at least the mental muscles got exercised because there was nothing else to do; now I look around and see heads buried in phones before they’ve even learned the basic physics of attention, never trained in the first place, and I can’t shake the image of a future where we’re not enlightened cyborgs but atavistic primates with a supercomputer in our pocket and nothing in our skull but notifications—civilization as a perfect interface over a hollowed-out user.

I am afraid of the future. 

The shopkeeper hands me the biscuits, my phone screen already asleep, the green tick gone as if it never existed, and I step outside into the street where everything is complicated again—traffic as a living theorem, humans as impatient variables, the city as a proof that never ends—so I walk on, carrying my small purchase like a minor treaty with chaos.
