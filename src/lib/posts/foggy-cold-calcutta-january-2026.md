January in Calcutta arrives like a damp clerk with a rubber stamp and a personal grudge, and this year it came foggy and forlorn and cold in that uncharacteristic way that makes the city look briefly European—if Europe were run by a committee of exhaust pipes—so I woke up with my mouth tasting like I’d been French-kissed by a bus depot, my nostrils crusted with a paste made of particulate matter and yesterday’s bad decisions, and my stomach already doing that anxious municipal gurgle, the kind that says, good morning sir, we have scheduled your humiliation between tea and toothbrush.

The fog hangs low, not romantic, not cinematic, not some wistful Dickensian mist where orphans sing for pennies, but a practical, working-class fog, the sort that clocks in at 6 a.m. and says, today we will trap everything you’ve ever burned, belched, or bribed into the air, and we will keep it right here at nose level, like a landlord. You can almost feel the inversion layer—there’s a science word for it, and of course there is, because humans love naming the ways we poison ourselves—cold air squatting below, warm air above, a neat little lid on a pot of urban stew, so the smoke and soot and microscopic tire dust and the ghosts of a thousand street-side frying pans just linger, suspended, as if the city is holding its breath and refusing to exhale until somebody pays the bribe.

I shuffle to the bathroom because my body, in its infinite wisdom, has decided that the first act of consciousness must be a shit, as if the day cannot begin until I’ve produced something, anything, even if it’s only a turd that looks like it was designed by a depressed architect. The toilet is cold enough to make a man briefly religious, and I sit there thinking, this is how civilization ends: not with fire, not with flood, but with a freezing ceramic kiss on the ass and a slow, offended fart that echoes like a complaint filed in the wrong office.

Outside, someone is already honking, because in this city the horn is not a tool, it’s a personality, a philosophy, a national anthem for people who think noise is proof of existence, and the fog makes the sound travel in a weird, thick way, like it’s wading through gravy, so every honk becomes a long, damp sigh. A neighbor’s television is blasting some studio hippo—bright tie, bright teeth, empty head—bellowing “breaking” news with the desperate energy of a man trying to sell you a miracle cure for baldness and democracy at the same time, and the cold air carries it right through my walls, so even my silence has an accompaniment.

This is the part where older writers talk about nostalgia, about how winter mornings used to be, about coal fires and sweaters and the sweet smell of incense and family, but my childhood was not a postcard either; it was just the same shit in a different wrapper, and the wrapper was colonial hangover and underpaid men and too much faith in slogans. People love telling you that Calcutta’s decay is poetic, as if crumbling concrete is a genre, but it isn’t poetry when you can taste it. It’s just rot, and rot has an odor, and the odor is mostly diesel.

Still, the city does a trick in January: it briefly pretends it has lungs. You can see the sun sometimes as a pale coin behind the fog, like a deity that has lost interest and is now doing administrative work elsewhere. And because my brain is cursed with books—too many fucking books, like I’ve been force-fed libraries the way a goose is force-fed grain—I can’t just experience the cold; I have to annotate it. I start thinking about how the British built drains for a smaller population and then left, like a man who renovates one room and declares the whole house modern, and now we live inside this inherited plumbing of empire and jugaar, where everything is patched, nothing is planned, and the only consistent policy is “adjust.”

The cold makes the body petty. In summer you sweat and you forgive, because everyone is equally damp and defeated, but in winter you become sharp, you become a critic, you become the kind of man who notices everything and likes nothing. My skin is dry and itchy; my lips crack; my joints behave like old bureaucrats, slow to move and eager to complain. I cough, and the cough feels like a moral judgment. Every breath has texture. The air isn’t air; it’s a mixture, a slurry, a civic smoothie made of PM2.5 and regret, and the lungs—those delicate pink idiots—have to filter it with the same optimism with which our politicians filter truth.

And sex, of course, is there like a stray dog that follows you home and refuses to leave, except this dog has mange and bad timing. In winter, desire shows up wearing a sweater and a smirk, tapping my shoulder like, hello, remember me, and I’m like, yes, unfortunately, I remember you, I have receipts, I have shame, I have a browser history like a crime scene, and my body, this traitorous committee, responds with the enthusiasm of a government office after lunch: sluggish, inconsistent, occasionally active at precisely the wrong moment. Nothing is heroic here. There is no Casanova. There is only me, a middle-aged man in a cold room, feeling the old stupid circuitry light up while the rest of my system files a complaint.

The worst part is that the city itself is erotic in a miserable way. Everything is too close, too loud, too intimate; you can hear couples arguing through walls, you can smell frying oil from three floors away, you can feel the neighbor’s bassline in your teeth like a dentist’s drill, and the fog makes it all thicker, more claustrophobic, like the whole metropolis is pressing its damp forehead to your window and whispering, you cannot escape, you will die here, and also the fish is stale today.

I make tea, because tea is the only ritual I still respect, and even then I drink it with the grim devotion of a man taking medicine. The kettle whistles like it’s auditioning for a role as my conscience. The cup warms my hands and I immediately resent how easily comfort can be purchased by boiling water, as if my entire philosophy could be defeated by a mug. The tea tastes like tannin and compromise. I stand by the window and watch the fog swallow the lane, and I can barely see the outlines of people moving like ghosts, except the ghosts are carrying plastic bags and shouting into phones and spitting with confidence.

There’s a particular kind of nationalism in this air, not the flag-waving kind, but the everyday one: the belief that because we have survived worse, we don’t need to improve. Suffering becomes identity, and identity becomes excuse, and excuse becomes policy. You mention pollution and someone says, “At least we’re not starving,” as if oxygen is a luxury item, as if breathing clean air is some decadent foreign kink. You mention noise and someone says, “You’re too sensitive,” as if sensitivity is a moral failure rather than a nervous system doing its job. The city trains you to accept insult as normal. It’s like living with a motherfucker who keeps stepping on your toes and then calls you dramatic for limping.

Science tries to explain it, and I love science, because science at least is honest about its ignorance, it says, here is what we measured, here is the uncertainty, here is the range, and the air in January measures badly. Cold air is denser, so it sits heavy. Fog forms when the air cools to the dew point and water condenses on particles—so the more filthy particles you have, the more convenient little hooks there are for water to cling to, like the city has provided the fog with furniture. Sound travels differently too; temperature gradients bend it, humidity changes absorption, and all that means your neighbor’s television can invade your skull in “stereo and 8D surround,” and the studio hippos can waddle straight into your living room without paying rent.

Meanwhile my body is doing its own physics experiment: how many indignities can be generated from one aging endocrine system. I sweat under blankets in a room that feels like a meat locker. My armpits smell like despair even when I haven’t moved. My digestion alternates between sluggish and vindictive. I piss more often because cold makes the blood vessels constrict and the kidneys get cocky, and the whole thing is like living inside a badly managed apartment complex where the plumbing and electricity keep arguing about whose fault it is.

I try to read, because reading is my drug of choice, my respectable addiction, my way of pretending I’m above the gutter while my body keeps dragging me back into it by the ankle. But even reading in this cold has a physicality: the pages feel dry, the fingers stiff, the eyes watery from smoke and fatigue. The mind wanders anyway, because the mind is not a monk; it’s a drunk monkey with a PhD, and it keeps swinging from thought to thought, from old humiliations to new anxieties, from grand political despair to petty erotic nonsense, and the whole time there’s this fog outside like a visual metaphor I didn’t ask for, insisting on being symbolic.

Memory in winter is a bastard. It doesn’t bring you the good scenes; it brings you the awkward ones, the ones where you said something stupid to a woman you liked, the ones where you misread a glance and built a whole fantasy empire on it and then watched it collapse like a cheap flyover. The cold makes the past feel closer, like it’s sitting on the bed beside you, breathing. I remember the American winters I once endured, with their clean cold and their honest snow, and I feel a dull, unromantic grief—not for the country, not for the “dream,” but for the simple fact that the air there didn’t feel like an insult. Here, every inhale is a negotiation.

And yes, I know: I could “exercise,” I could “meditate,” I could “practice gratitude,” I could become one of those tidy self-improvement motherfuckers who treat the body like a startup and the soul like a productivity app. But I am not a project; I am a person, and a person is mostly a bag of contradictions leaking through pores. The city doesn’t help. It encourages the worst in you: impatience, suspicion, laziness, rage. It teaches you to shout because shouting is the only language that cuts through. It teaches you to hoard because scarcity is always one bad week away. It teaches you to lie a little because truth is expensive and honesty doesn’t always get a receipt.

By late morning the fog thins, not because the city has improved, but because the sun has simply bullied it into retreat, and the street reappears like a face you don’t particularly like but have to live with. Vendors set up. Dogs argue. Men in sweaters pose as if winter is an achievement. Somewhere, someone lights incense, and it mixes with exhaust, and for a second the smell is almost tolerable, almost tender, like the city is trying to apologize with a cheap perfume.

I step out anyway because staying inside makes the body too loud. The cold hits the lungs and they complain. The air tastes of smoke and frying oil and wet concrete. The pavement is damp, and every puddle looks like it contains a small history of neglect. I walk past a tea stall and watch a man blow into his hands, and I think about how humans are the only creatures who can invent satellites and still have to warm their fingers over a cup because the world remains, at its core, indifferent.

On the bus, packed and fog-breathed and sour with human proximity, my body decides to stage one last little prank, a small, unwanted physiological memo delivered at the worst time, because of course it does, because the nervous system is a twat with comedic instincts and no ethics, and I stand there gripping the rail, staring straight ahead like a saint made of shame, praying not for enlightenment but for my own bloodstream to stop freelancing in public, while the city rattles along in the cold, honking and coughing and pretending this is normal.
