I was on the commode, shirtless, of course, and sweating from the nape like a goat in a pressure cooker, knees sharp as two guilted elbows folded upward and the bastard of a fan clicking like a Stalinist typewriter above me, when I heard it again—Apophis.

Not the snake, not the myth, not the Egyptian chaos-god bullshit—but the asteroid, the fucking literal space-rock gunning for us in 2029 like some cold, jagged celestial hemorrhoid traveling at Mach Jesus with the sole aim of turning Earth into a glazed ceramic toilet bowl of sizzling crust and screams. And I thought, mid-shit, gripping the mop handle like it was the severed arm of Jesus, wouldn’t it be funny—I mean wouldn’t it be just hysterically tragicomic in the Charlie Hebdo jerking-off-in-a-bomb-shelter kind of way—if this, this was it.

Me—naked from the waist down, shitting, the apocalypse whistling down from the Kuiper belt like God's unlubed dildo, and I'm constipated, of course, because I ate too many of those low-fiber goddamn Marie biscuits again with the old tea that tastes like abandonment.

Because of course I’ll be one of the ones who dies. Of course.

I’m always the motherfucker who dies. Last in line, ticket doesn’t scan, cock gets bitten by a dog, coffee spills on the only job application I printed, pimple bursts during the one Zoom call where a woman actually smiled politely, train leaves early *once* in Indian Railways history and it’s the day I arrive sober and ten minutes ahead, and now—now Apophis, Apophis is the thing that kills me, a 340-meter-thick chucklefuck from the sky that NASA named like an ancient Greek butt plug, whose orbit, as of last I read from some wheezy pale Mormon with a YouTube face and haircut, was deemed “unlikely to hit Earth” but “not impossible.”  
I masturbate to less hopeful odds.

Some people imagine death as this clean, Shakespearean finale—  
I imagine mine looking like this:  

**I’m crouched, farting wet mustard air, porridge-colored turd hanging like a regretful bat from my asshole, the plastic commode ring making a slow tearing sound beneath me because it’s cracked from last summer’s sweat swell.**

And then  
boom.  

No flash, no Spielberg, no Bruce Willis oil-rig bravado—just 20,000 Hiroshimas’ worth of gamma-ray throatfuck kissing the Earth while I’m wondering if I should switch to mint toothpaste.  
You know they say if it hits the Pacific, it’ll vaporize half the ocean’s plankton in a thermal bloom so intense that it makes Krakatoa look like a birthday fart.  
Not the whole Earth, mind you, but just enough to ensure everything tastes like burnt plastic and cock for 600 years.

They’ll call it an extinction-level event but really it’s just Earth finally ejecting its USB stick without clicking safely remove.

I used to dream of space.  
Read Sagan.  
Scribbled planets on my stomach in blue ballpoint pen and tried to name the moons of Jupiter while jerking off to low-res Pamela Anderson gifs on a Pentium III in 1999.  
Now I can’t climb stairs without farting loudly and hoping the dog next door takes the blame.  
Apophis, you say?  
Fuck, I say—at least make it quick.

The irony, of course, is they named it after chaos, but now that I think about it, that rock has more purpose, more determined vectorial confidence than I’ve had in fifteen years of scabby ambition and half-written grant proposals.  
It’s going somewhere.  
I’m not.

That thing is coming with speed, direction, conviction—and probably a better diet than me.  
I'm bloated on aloo kabli, gut like a sack of wet hair, shitting wrong, pissing often, hair migrating from scalp to shoulder to ear like some nomadic fungal tribe.

And here’s the real clincher:  
I’ve masturbated to Apophis.  
Not to the rock, you fuck.  
But to the idea.

To the fantasy of not having to endure—not having to continue this farcical zombie-crawl of LinkedIn self-optimizing fuckboys and hashtag wellness, where I’m expected to be grateful for power outages and water drips and 1-bar mobile signal and the immense pride of a nation that still can’t build a sidewalk without killing three dogs and a baby.

You know what a 500 megaton impact looks like?  
It looks like relief.

Some say it'll miss.  
Just glide past us, a cosmic tease.  
A testicle brush.  
A smirk.  

Like those women in my twenties who’d sit close, laugh at all my jokes, graze my thigh, then marry an auditor.  
I’ve been hit harder by Indian matchmaking.

And even if it hits—do you think the people worth killing will die?  
No.  
Jeff Bezos has a fuckcave in the Andes with air filters from Mars.  
Elon Musk will upload his ego to a pocket pussy in orbit.  
Putin will be embalmed and sold as a chew toy to a radioactive bear.

I will die, however.  
In this damp shanty of leaking roofs and dead lizards in light fixtures because I didn’t vote right, because I didn’t save, because I spent money on books and condoms I never used.

If it’s not Apophis, it’ll be diabetes or dengue or one of those funky new antibiotic-resistant UTIs that feel like someone inserted a curling iron into your urethra and set it to “Colonial Torture.”

And just when I think maybe I can still live, maybe I can still write, maybe I can still matter—  
I sneeze  
and fart  
and forget what I was saying.

I watched a video of Apophis last night, right hand clutching myself, half-hopeful, thinking, “Maybe I’ll come before it hits.”

But I didn’t.  
I went soft halfway through an animation of the impact trajectory and ended up wiping semen and shame from my belly while the buffering wheel spun like the Eye of God deciding if I should die now or in three years or keep living until my prostate turns into a sentient beanbag.

Apophis, if you’re listening—don’t be late.  
Hit hard.  
Make it loud.  
Turn me to glass and let some alien dig me up in 4 billion years and wonder why this once-living creature died mid-shit with a semi and a YouTube tab still open to “Top 10 Planet-Killer Asteroids (With Real Science!)”
