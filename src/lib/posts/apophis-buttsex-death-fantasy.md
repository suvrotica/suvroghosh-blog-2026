I was perched on the throne, shirtless, naturally, and glowing with perspiration like a wheel of cheese left out in the sun. My knees were folded upward, sharp as two accusing elbows, and the winter wind was rattling the broken pane in the bathroom window like an angry bureaucrat typing a rejection letter above me. That is when I heard it again—Apophis.

Not the snake, not the myth, not the ancient Egyptian embodiment of chaos—but the asteroid. The literal space rock gunning for us in 2029 like a celestial bowling ball traveling at a speed that defies comprehension, with the sole aim of turning Earth into a glazed ceramic bowl of sizzling crust and regret. And I thought, gripping the mop handle as if it were a royal scepter, wouldn’t it be funny—I mean, wouldn’t it be just hysterically tragicomic in a *New Yorker* cartoon sort of way—if this was it?

Me—indisposed, unclothed from the waist down, the apocalypse whistling down from the Kuiper belt like a cosmic eviction notice, and I am stuck here, regretful, mostly because I ate too many of those dry Marie biscuits again with tea that tasted largely of sorrow.

Because, of course, I’ll be one of the ones who goes. Of course.

I’m always the person who misses the boat. I’m the last in line, the ticket that doesn’t scan, the trousers that snag on the door handle, the coffee that spills on the only clean shirt I own. I am the man who arrives at the train station ten minutes early on the one day in the history of Indian Railways that the train leaves five minutes ahead of schedule. And now—now Apophis. Apophis is the thing that gets me, a 340-meter-thick boulder from the sky that NASA named with ominous gravity, whose orbit, as of the last update I heard from a very pale scientist on YouTube, was deemed "unlikely to hit Earth" but "not impossible."

I have bought lottery tickets with worse odds.

Some people imagine death as this clean, Shakespearean finale. I imagine mine looking like this:

**I’m crouched, staring at the peeling paint, the air thick with humidity and poor choices, the plastic ring of the seat making a slow, complaining sound beneath me because it cracked during last summer's heatwave.**

And then
boom.

No cinematic flash, no swelling orchestra, no Bruce Willis saving the day with oil-rig bravado—just the equivalent of 20,000 Hiroshimas arriving for a visit while I’m wondering if I should switch to a sensitive-teeth toothpaste.

You know, they say if it hits the Pacific, it’ll vaporize enough water to create a thermal bloom so intense it makes Krakatoa look like a pop-gun. Not the whole Earth, mind you, but just enough to ensure everything tastes like burnt toast and disappointment for the next 600 years.

They’ll call it an extinction-level event, but really, it’s just Earth finally ejecting its USB stick without clicking "Safely Remove Hardware."



I used to dream of space.
I read Sagan.
I scribbled planets on my stomach in blue ballpoint pen and tried to name the moons of Jupiter while looking at low-resolution pictures of galaxies on a Pentium III in 1999.
Now, I can’t climb a flight of stairs without my knees making a sound like crushing celery.
Apophis, you say?
Fine, I say—at least make it quick.

The irony, of course, is that they named it after chaos, but now that I think about it, that rock has more purpose, more determined vectorial confidence than I’ve had in fifteen years of half-finished projects and abandoned hobbies.
It’s going somewhere.
I’m not.

That thing is coming with speed, direction, conviction—and probably a better diet than me.
I'm bloated on potato curry, feeling heavy, sitting incorrectly, worrying often, with hair migrating from my scalp to my ears like some nomadic tribe seeking new territory.

And here’s the real clincher:
I’ve found comfort in Apophis.
Not the rock itself, obviously.
But the idea.

The fantasy of not having to endure—not having to continue this farcical crawl through LinkedIn updates and self-optimization seminars, where I’m expected to be grateful for power outages, water drips, and a mobile signal weak enough to be defeated by a stiff breeze.

You know what a 500-megaton impact looks like?
It looks like a day off.

Some say it'll miss.
Just glide past us, a cosmic tease.
A polite wave from across the room.
A smirk.

Like those people in my twenties who would sit close, laugh at my jokes, and then marry an accountant.
I’ve been let down harder by the arranged marriage market.

And even if it hits—do you think the people who actually run things will be affected?
No.
The billionaires have bunkers in the Andes with air filters imported from the future.
The tech moguls will upload their consciousness to a server in orbit.
Politicians will be safely tucked away, preserved like pickles in a jar.

I will go, however.
In this damp house with the leaking roof, staring at a dead lizard in the light fixture, because I didn’t save enough, because I spent money on hardbound books I never read and gym memberships I never used.

If it’s not Apophis, it’ll be sugar levels or the traffic or one of those new, exciting antibiotic-resistant ailments that makes you feel as though you are aging in fast-forward.

And just when I think maybe I can still live, maybe I can still write, maybe I can still matter—
I sneeze,
lose my train of thought,
and forget what I was doing.

I watched a video about Apophis last night, clutching my phone, half-hopeful, thinking, "Maybe I’ll find some clarity before it hits."

But I didn’t.
I lost interest halfway through an animation of the impact trajectory and ended up wiping cookie crumbs from my stomach while the buffering wheel spun like the Eye of God deciding if I should go now or in three years.

Apophis, if you’re listening—don’t be late.
Hit hard.
Make it loud.
Turn me to glass and let some alien archeologist dig me up in 4 billion years and wonder why this once-living creature perished in the bathroom with a confused look on his face and a YouTube tab still open to “Top 10 Planet-Killer Asteroids (With Real Science!).”
