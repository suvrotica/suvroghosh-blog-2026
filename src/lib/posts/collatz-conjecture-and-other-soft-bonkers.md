It began, like all great questions in my life do, while I was attempting to take a shit at 4:17 a.m., ass cheeks cold against the cracked ceramic toilet seat that pinches like a jealous ex-wife when the hinge slips, my intestines fighting entropy in looping, recursive waves—half gas, half philosophical lamentation, all treason—and I was thinking about the Collatz Conjecture.

Which, if you’re lucky enough to be blissfully ignorant of, is one of those loopy math problems that sounds like a children’s rhyme written by a schizophrenic god: take any positive integer, and if it’s even, halve it, if it’s odd, triple it and add one, and repeat, and repeat, and repeat, until you reach the number one, where presumably you die or orgasm or are issued your final tax notice by the cosmic IRS.

Every number tested ends up collapsing down to one. Every single one. Like a queue of horny, overpromised integers lining up for tantric enlightenment but always getting a damp, apologetic handjob instead. You go up, you go down, you bounce, you wiggle, you hope—and then thud. One. One. Fucking One. Like the universe has exactly one punchline and it's a bald, monotone yes-man of a number. One. The premature ejaculation of results.

This is not math. This is spiritual trolling.

I remember the first time I tried it. Not in a notebook or Python console, no—like a twat, I tried it in my head, on a bus, stuck next to a man who smelled like parboiled goat smegma and old Vicks VapoRub. I started with 7. 7 is odd. 3×7+1 = 22. 22 is even, halve it, 11. 11 is odd, triple and add one—34. 17. 52. 26. 13. And then it all went to cocksucking hell. I forgot if 20 was even. I forgot if I was on 20 or 40. I forgot how numbers worked. I got off the bus six stops early and walked home like a whipped dog, feeling like I’d failed a Sudoku designed by Kafka.

But it gnaws. Oh, it fucking gnaws.

Like a nagging, half-soft erection you don’t want, don’t need, but it’s there, leaking a little pre-come of curiosity every time you close your eyes. Like mathematical priapism. Why the fuck do all numbers go to 1? Why doesn’t some big integer just say no, fuck you, I’m orbiting forever, I’m partying with infinity, you little piss-ant logic monkey.

But no.

Every number we’ve ever checked, all trillions of the little fuckers, eventually curl up like a shamed dog and slink back to 1. A mathematical self-flagellation. Even the rebel numbers submit.

Which, naturally, reminds me of my own life.

Because I, too, am stuck in a recursive shit-loop. Wake up. Coffee. Check WhatsApp to see who hasn’t messaged me. Cook eggs with the grace of a defeated Michelin chef in an asbestos hut. Avoid calling my mother. Avoid mirror. Sit. Masturbate to nostalgia. Collapse. Repeat.

Odd? Triple yourself. Add one guilt. Even? Divide your ambitions by two.

Repeat.

Until one.

And fuck me, I’ve been 1 for a while now.

The beauty of Collatz is its absurdity. The nightmare of Collatz is also its absurdity. There's no proof. No counterexample. Just endless numeric BDSM. Mathematicians, poor dry-dicked souls, have spent decades poking this with the academic equivalent of a limp stick, hoping to find a leak, a flaw, a crack in the cosmic toilet bowl. But the bowl keeps flushing. Every number goes glug-glug down to 1.

I once read that Terence Tao—yes, *that* brain-having demigod with a face like an innocent spreadsheet—made progress on Collatz. Which is like saying someone lit a scented candle in hell. It still smells like shit, but now it's lavender-scented and peer-reviewed.

And speaking of hell—have you tried explaining this to an Indian auntie?

I once tried. She asked what I did all day. I said I think about numbers. She looked at me like I’d pulled my pants down and farted out an Upanishad.

"What number?"

"Any number."

"Why?"

"I want to know where they go."

"But they go to one. What is there to think?"

And she’s right, that saggy-chinned, turmeric-smelling domestic philosopher. What the fuck *is* there to think?

They go to 1.

So why do I still feel like I’m spiraling, shitting my way through loops of 3n+1 despair?

Maybe it’s because Collatz is just the math version of being Bengali in South Calcutta after 50. A slow, predictable descent into sameness. Every dream halved. Every rebellion tripled and made ridiculous. Every odd move punished with an even return. Everything ends with you sitting alone with cheap looseleaf Darjeeling and two half-rotten bananas, wondering if today’s the day you finally unclog the drain or let it form a bacterial ecosystem.

We keep doing things not because they’ll work, but because we *have* to do them.

Like this blog.

Like checking to see if someone’s read your WhatsApp.

Like going back to 1.

Even Ramanujan wouldn’t touch this crap. He’d glance at it between tuberculosis coughs, mutter something about partition functions, and go back to dying poetically. Meanwhile, the rest of us sit here with our itchy assholes and our broken dreams and our stupid integers, counting and counting and counting like cocksuckers on a cosmic abacus from hell.

I think the real answer to the Collatz Conjecture is: because fuck you, that’s why.

The universe doesn’t owe us elegance. It doesn’t owe us proof. It owes us exactly the same thing it owes every number in the sequence: a humiliating dance and a quiet collapse.

And if you listen closely—if you lie in bed at 3:12 a.m. with your spine cramping and your bladder full of slightly expired tea—you can hear it in your own thoughts:

Odd. Triple. Add guilt.

Even. Halve your expectations.

Repeat.

One.

One.

One.
