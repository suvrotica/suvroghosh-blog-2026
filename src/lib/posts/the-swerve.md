The copy I have now is brand new—Amazon.in, midnight-blue cloth, coral-orange dots scattered across the cover like atoms pretending to be constellations, a tidy border holding the whole swarm in place, and a little red ribbon bookmark poking out like a private joke. It even smells new: paper, glue, that faint chemical cleanliness of something that hasn’t yet been handled by despair. I still open it carefully, though, because my last library didn’t slowly die on shelves; it was taken in Hyderabad in one greedy gulp—fifteen thousand books hauled from the US, plus the intimate junk that makes a person administratively real (passport, underwear, the whole inventory of identity). Ever since, every “new” book arrives with the quiet, unreasonable solemnity of a replacement organ.

Lucretius. Titus Lucretius Carus. *De Rerum Natura.* A title that sounds like it should come with a brass plaque and a dead moth, but inside it’s oddly unceremonious: atoms, void, the blunt fact that the world is made of stuff moving in space, and that most of our spiritual drama is a kind of nervous overinterpretation of thunderstorms.

A mosquito whines somewhere in January—Kolkata does that, it keeps one foot in every season like a man who can’t commit to a relationship—and I think: I should have met this man earlier. I should have met him instead of being marched, like a well-ironed colonial orphan, toward Julius Caesar and the idea that *civilization* is a thing that arrives wearing a toga and delivering monologues.

Not that Shakespeare is the villain. Shakespeare is rarely the villain. Shakespeare is the big banyan tree that everybody sits under because there’s shade and tradition and a certain flattering feeling that one is doing Serious Things with the mind. But there is something comically perverse about the curriculum decisions we’ve inherited—like being given a perfectly good microscope and being told to admire the velvet case it came in.

Because Julius Caesar teaches you politics as theatre: ambition, betrayal, rhetoric, crowds that change opinions the way Kolkata changes traffic signals (purely as decoration). And yes, it’s brilliant, and yes, it’s human, and yes, it’s useful—especially in a country where speeches are often substituted for plumbing. But Lucretius teaches you something rarer and more urgent: the universe does not care about your slogans, your caste fantasies, your sacred geography, your imported resentments, your frantic insistence that your tribe was chosen by a cosmic HR department.

He gives you a world that runs without needing to flatter us.

And that—this unromantic, almost rude independence of reality—is exactly what we keep failing to teach.

# The Swerve, Literally

Lucretius has this deliciously strange idea, the one every physics-tinged philosopher eventually wants to lick like a forbidden sweet: atoms falling through the void, parallel as rain, until—*swerve*—one deviates for no ordained reason, and suddenly collisions happen, patterns happen, life happens, history happens, and you and I happen, arguing on the internet like two nervous mammals trying to negotiate meaning out of an indifferent cosmos.

The *clinamen.* The swerve.

It’s the sort of idea that makes religious people angry because it suggests the universe isn’t a moral screenplay, and it makes certain rationalists smug because it sounds like an ancient preview of modern stochasticity—randomness dressed in a Roman toga. It is neither a proof nor a prophecy; it’s a working intuition in poem-form, and the poem is doing what poems do best: sneaking contraband concepts across the border of the ordinary mind.

But here’s the part that makes me want to fling this book like a brick through the window of our education ministries (purely metaphorically, officer, purely metaphorically): he uses the swerve not to sell hope, not to sell destiny, but to puncture fear.

Fear of gods. Fear of death. Fear that reality is a tyrant with moods. Fear that some unseen authority is taking notes.

He is trying—two thousand years ago—to give the reader a nervous system upgrade.

And then, in 2026, in a country that exports software engineers and imports superstition by the shipping container, we still treat that upgrade like an optional plugin.

# School as a Myth Factory

The Indian classroom—how do I put this without sounding like a bitter uncle at a wedding?—is often a myth factory wearing a lab coat. Not always. There are heroic teachers. There are bright pockets. There are students who claw their way to clarity like plants through concrete. But as a system, it loves obedience more than understanding, recitation more than inspection, reverence more than curiosity. It’s a place where “knowledge” is frequently defined as the ability to reproduce text on command, which is also the job description of a photocopier, minus the existential dread.

Into that environment we pour, with great confidence, a curriculum that is part colonial museum, part exam-prep treadmill, part nationalistic mood board. The results are predictable: people who can solve problems if the problem looks exactly like the last ten problems, people who can recite the “scientific temper” clause while consulting astrologers for marriage dates, people who talk about “ancient science” with the moist eyes of a man describing a lost love—except the lost love is usually an unverified WhatsApp forward.

Here is where Lucretius would be a small, sharp corrective. Not because he’s *Western* (as if atoms have passports), not because he’s *Roman* (as if truth cares about empire), but because his entire posture is anti-enchantment. He does not ask you to kneel. He asks you to look.

And looking—actual looking—is revolutionary in a society that runs on prestige hallucinations.

We teach children to memorize. Lucretius teaches adults to *unmemorize.* To peel away the sticky myths that cling to the mind because they are comforting, because they are socially rewarded, because they make you feel like your suffering has a purpose and your enemies are cosmically doomed. He offers, instead, the blunt dignity of explanation.

Which sounds cold until you realize: cold is sometimes exactly what a fever needs.

# Etymology

There’s a kind of folk etymology that floats around educated circles like a polite parasite: the idea that if you can split a word into pieces, you can extract a hidden truth, like cracking open a coconut and finding philosophy inside. This is how people end up “proving” that their favorite language invented science, democracy, the internet, and possibly the airplane.

It’s comforting nonsense.

Words are not sacred fossils. They’re messy survivors. *Natura*—nature—doesn’t mean “that which is holy.” It comes through notions of birth, arising, being produced; it’s a concept with dirt under its fingernails. *Religio*—often translated as religion—has disputed roots, but what matters for Lucretius is not the philological trivia; it’s his *attitude* toward it. He treats superstition as a social technology of fear. Not a personal spiritual hobby. A mechanism.

And mechanism is his theme: the world is mechanisms all the way down, not in a reductionist “you are nothing but atoms” insult, but in a liberating “you are not cursed by invisible judges” reassurance.

In India, we do the opposite. We use etymology like incense—wave it around, feel wise, then go right back to believing that planets dictate destiny and that women’s bodies are polluted on a schedule. We treat language as a credential, not a tool. We produce a class of people who can pronounce “epistemology” and still panic at the sight of uncertainty.

Lucretius would laugh. Not cruelly. More like a tired doctor watching a patient insist that fever is caused by bad vibes.

# Shakespeare, Caesar, and the Indian Talent for Amphitheatre

Julius Caesar is, among other things, a study in crowd psychology. Brilliant speeches. Mob volatility. The way an audience can be turned with a few well-placed phrases, a theatrical pause, a strategically revealed wound. In this sense, yes, Shakespeare is painfully relevant to India, where the political bloodstream is thick with oratory and the public is treated as a mood to be managed.

But the problem is: we already *live* in Caesar. We don’t need more training in the aesthetics of manipulation. We need training in the immunology of manipulation.

Lucretius is immunology.

He doesn’t teach you how to win the crowd; he teaches you how not to be won by the crowd. He makes you suspicious of cosmic stories that flatter your tribe. He makes you ask: what is the simplest explanation that fits the facts? What is the chain of causes? What is the evidence? Where does fear enter, and who profits from it?

This is not “Western thought.” This is hygiene.

And hygiene is what we lack—not only in drains and rivers, but in epistemics, in public reasoning, in the national ability to tell the difference between a claim and a demonstration.

# My Own Contradiction, Served Hot

At this point I can hear the imaginary reader—some earnest, well-fed person with a LinkedIn profile full of “thought leadership”—saying: “But poetry? For science? Isn’t that backwards?”

Yes. Exactly. Backwards in the way that sometimes you have to approach a locked door from an angle because the handle is broken.

Lucretius isn’t writing a textbook. He’s writing a seduction. He’s trying to coax minds away from supernatural terror using the only technology that reliably penetrates human defensiveness: beauty. Rhythm. Image. Metaphor. The thing that slides past the guards.

And here is my contradiction: I despise performative intellectualism *even while performing it.* I can feel myself enjoying the posture of being the man who reads Latin poets in a cramped Kolkata room, and I want to slap myself lightly for it. *Besh, babu, very cultured.* But the fact remains: ideas need carriers. In India, we keep choosing carriers that are spiritually branded, politically convenient, and intellectually lazy.

We choose myths because they travel well.

Lucretius is hard to package into a nationalist sermon. He refuses to play mascot. He does not offer civilizational pride. He offers cosmic modesty.

Which is precisely why he should be compulsory.

# Ten or Twenty Years, I Claim?

I claim that if India has to succeed in ten or twenty years, this adjustment must be made. It sounds dramatic, like something said into a microphone with background music. A country is not a student I can threaten into studying, but I see we need to inculcate rationality at the national level and pronto. 

The timeline is real: the next couple decades will punish societies that can’t think clearly. Not morally punish. Mechanically punish. The way a badly built bridge “punishes” the first overloaded truck.

Climate, energy, public health, misinformation, automation—none of these care about our cultural self-esteem. They require systems that can test claims, update beliefs, and admit error without collapsing into shame. They require people trained to tolerate uncertainty long enough to examine it.

Our education system trains the opposite reflex: certainty as virtue, doubt as defect, questioning as insolence unless it is performed within safe, pre-approved lanes.

Lucretius trains the spine. The calm refusal to be terrified by the unknown. The ability to say: *I don’t know yet,* and not immediately fill the gap with gods, gurus, or glorious ancestors.

That ability is not a luxury. It’s infrastructure.

And yes, I know how ridiculous it sounds to propose a Roman poet as national infrastructure. But India is a place where we routinely propose stone idols as infrastructure, so let’s not pretend we’re allergic to symbolic overreach.

# Small Scene Again, Because the Body Keeps Score

The kettle has boiled dry once, a sad metallic smell rising like a warning. The room is quiet in the specific way that South Kolkata can be quiet—quiet with distant horns, quiet with a neighbor’s TV leaking a devotional serial, quiet with the occasional clatter of a utensil like a dropped coin in the well of the day.

I look at the book again. In the margin near a passage about fear, someone has written a single Bengali word, underlined twice: *bhoy.*

Fear.

That’s the real syllabus, isn’t it. Not Shakespeare versus Lucretius. Not East versus West. Not tradition versus modernity. Fear versus inspection. Fear versus explanation. Fear versus the stubborn, almost unglamorous courage to look at the world without a cosmic comfort blanket.

I close the book gently—not reverently, just gently, like you close a door when someone is sleeping—and the dust rises in a thin slant of light, drifting with all the lazy confidence of atoms in a room that has seen too many prayers and not enough experiments. 

<Yt src="https://youtu.be/VGk24PddSf4?si=0Dd84wOHUpK7h1at" />

Somewhere in the middle of all this—atoms, void, fear as a management strategy—I keep hearing *Master of Puppets* on the piano, specifically the Gamazda version, because my brain has apparently appointed her as the official musician of my private nervous system. She’s also, embarrassingly, one of the only pianists who can lift my depressive lows by a measurable notch—like someone quietly opening a window in a room I’d forgotten had air. It makes no historical sense and perfect emotional sense: the most mechanized, clenched-jaw metal song of my adolescence, stripped of distortion and bravado and translated into an instrument built to make grief sound civilized. In her hands the famous riff turns into an engine diagram, a little deterministic treadmill: motif repeats, the hand obeys, the body falls into time, and whatever you call “choice” is reduced to a finger deciding whether to land a millimeter early or late. That’s Lucretius in disguise—matter in motion, patterns that feel like fate until you look closely and notice the tiny human swerve, the micro-delay, the refusal to be perfectly machine. And it’s India in 2026, if we’re honest: a country full of people who think they’re playing the anthem of freedom while invisible hands—syllabi, gods, caste, parties, gurus, algorithms—pull the strings, and the first step toward adulthood is to hear the puppet-strings *as music* and then decide, awkwardly, to stop dancing.

I drink the tea. It’s gone cold.

*The universe, meanwhile, carries on without even the courtesy of an opinion.*
