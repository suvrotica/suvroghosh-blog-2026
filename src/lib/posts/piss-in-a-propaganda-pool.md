My shit was floaty that day. Not the satisfying, firm-banana-type turd with its pride intact and a polite goodbye splash, but the bloated, cowardly floater that keeps skimming the surface like a shamed bureaucrat dodging indictment. 

The stink wasn’t dramatic—more like a burnt toast of intestinal lies—but it lingered like post-curry farts on a cheap foam mattress in May. I sat there, cock in hand (not for any noble reason—just to keep it from accidentally touching the rim of the piss-splattered toilet bowl), staring at the news on my cracked Redmi screen while the fan overhead made that intermittent clack sound, like a pensioned-out soldier masturbating to patriotic reruns.  

**The headline said: “Nation Under Siege from Misinformation. Trust Only Official Sources.”**

Which, let’s be clear, is the bureaucratic equivalent of a rapist telling you he’s been celibate.  

Now look, when you’ve lived long enough to watch truth molested, gagged, and dumped into a shallow grave beside rationality and nuance, you begin to see the patterns—like the fibrous undigested green chile in your poop reminding you of last night’s roadside phuchka.

There was a time I thought logic mattered. That ideas could pierce through stupidity like laser through lard. That you could explain to someone why climate change is real, why caste is not just a relic but an everyday rectal itch in this country’s tight pants, why GDP doesn't mean your daughter won’t get molested in a police van.  

But now I know: truth is just a eunuch’s erection. Present, noticeable, but ultimately useless in court.

Let me tell you something my pancreas knows better than my brain—when a system doesn’t allow **truth**, it doesn’t just hide **facts**, it mutates **morality**. You can't tell what the fuck's rotten because the fridge light’s been broken for years, and some sweaty, betel-chewing uncle in a bureaucratic cubicle keeps assuring you it’s “traditional smell.”  

So suddenly, we’re at war with adjectives. Not missiles. Not poverty. Not feudalism disguised as management consulting. Just words. Forbidden words. “Genocide.” “Fascism.” “Authoritarian.” They’re not in the editorial style guide anymore. Like nipples in a CBFC-certified sex scene.

And all of this? Makes me feel like my balls are being slow-boiled by a Sanskrit-chanting sadhu who thinks global warming is a Western hoax and the moon has a fuckin' Wi-Fi router made by Ravana.

Back to the shitter—I felt the sweat run down my spine, cross my ass-crack, and disappear somewhere between the birthmark and the pile I pretend isn’t there. As I wiped with the sad, one-ply toilet paper that tears like secular values in a WhatsApp family group, I remembered my school civics teacher.

Who once said, “Right and wrong are shaped by truth.”

You suppress truth long enough, and suddenly “right” becomes whatever the fuck you can say without being lynched online or in a literal cow shelter. And “wrong” becomes...anything inconvenient. Like menstruation. Or Ambedkar.

I walk out of the bathroom. My morning tea is cold. The milk’s gone sour.  
I sip it anyway because, much like this nation’s tolerance levels, my standards have curdled beyond recognition.

The fan’s still clacking.  

The national press fondly called the Godi media, once the supposedly noble check-and-balance—like a moral butler gently reminding power not to shit on the carpet—has now become that same butler’s decomposing body in the basement, while the new one wears a party hat and gives blowjobs to the Prime Minister’s hologram.

What the fuck even is journalism anymore? Five men in a studio screaming like monkey dicks caught in electric fence wire? You can’t tell the difference between a news anchor and a gambling site advertisement with slightly more saffron.

Sometimes I think of Galileo, not because I give a fuck about telescopes (I’m shortsighted and broke), but because even in 1633, it took the Church less than a courtroom’s worth of ego to say, “Sit down, nerd. The Earth doesn’t move.”  
And we? We just upgraded the heresy software. Now the Sun revolves around the ruling party’s PR machinery, and dissent is a Chinese virus.

And here’s the terrifying part.

When truth dies—when it’s not murdered outright but just eroded slowly like foot skin in a public bath—you don't even need gulags or secret police anymore. The people start doing the job for you. Snitching. Screaming. Worshipping. They become a self-regulating gulag with data plans.

Your uncle from Jadavpur now calls you a traitor for asking why the GDP graph looks like his erectile curve after 50.

And there’s no fixing it.

Because once people stop knowing what’s true or false, they stop knowing what’s **real**.  
And if they can't tell real from fake, they sure as hell can't tell **right from wrong**.  
It all collapses into taste, tribe, tantrum.

And then? The whole country is just a giant open-mouth kiss between authoritarianism and amnesia, with history watching like a cuckolded lover whispering, “I told you so,” while fingering its exit wound.

So what do I do?

I make tea. I fuck it up.

I boil it too long. My hands are shaking. My gut rumbles again. Not hunger. Not sickness. Just that old moral nausea—truth constipation.

I open my mouth to scream and let out a fart instead. Long. Wet. Possibly dangerous.  
It’s the only honest sound I’ve made all day.
