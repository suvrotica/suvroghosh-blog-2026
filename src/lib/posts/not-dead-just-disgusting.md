It began with the smell of my own ass.

Which, frankly, wasn’t just my ass, but something far more sinister and posthuman—a fermented buttock stew that had stewed too long on a cheap plastic chair bought from some Bansdroni corner fuckhole furniture store operated by a permanently coughing ex-milkman and his piss-faced twat of a brother who both looked like they shat gravel and married their cousins for property. The chair now has a permanent wet stain. So do I.

The point is I hadn't bathed in three days. Or maybe four. Somewhere between existential inertia and that greasy blank scroll of time you forget to swipe, like when your screen freezes but it’s your life, and there’s a slight twitch in your boxer’s waistband like your dick wanted to participate in the plot but the story’s already dead, the narration stalled, and the protagonist—you—is a middle-aged brown skinbag with scalp dandruff, parched toenails, and a double chin that jiggles when he’s crying over cold rice in his electric fucking oven.

No, I’m not dead. But I *get* why people assume I might be. Because depression is a sneaky motherfucker. It doesn’t throw dramatic tantrums. No, it just sits there like a smug fart trapped inside an airplane seat, slowly poisoning your will to live while the smiling airhostess asks if you want masala peanuts or not. Depression, unlike death, needs constant management. Death at least ends the subscriptions.

And yet, like a fool with leftover erections and unanswered WhatsApp messages from former classmates turned startup crypto-gurus, I persist.

Now let me say something scientific before I drown in my own fucking bile.

See, in cryogenics, there’s this charming little thing called vitrification. It’s what they hope happens when they freeze dead rich cunts in tanks, hoping to preserve the cellular structures without forming the sharp ice crystals that rip through the membranes like a thousand tiny bayonets screaming “fuck your afterlife!” Depression, my darling, is emotional vitrification. You don’t rot. You just... suspend. Not dead, but also not alive. No warmth. No cell activity worth noting. Just frozen regret in viscous cerebrospinal syrup.

And much like those frozen dickhead billionaires, I too lie horizontal most of the day, only instead of a sci-fi preservation chamber I have a peeling floor mat that smells of Dettol, damp boxer sweat, and the ghost of my mother's cooking.

The worst part?

I *know* I’m not dead. My nose still works. And there’s no mistaking the rotting onion that’s been mating with a dead potato under the sink for 9 days. Which I still haven’t thrown out. I don’t throw *anything* out. There’s a curry from last week that’s developed a pellicle so thick I swear it winked at me once. My stomach turned, but I also got hard, which says more about the state of my dopamine receptors than I care to admit.

Let me also confess: I am a man who has masturbated to grainy 240p phone-captured videos of women coughing. Not sexy coughing. Just real ones. Tuberculosis-chic. Probably because it reminds me of home. Or of love. Who the fuck knows anymore. Point is: whatever the signal, the wiring's crossed, and the motor twitches inappropriately. The body remembers long after the brain’s declared bankruptcy.

Memory.

A few decades ago, I was a promising little twat. My teachers said I was going to *do* something. And I did. I left the country. Got a degree. Came back with a used rice cooker, a history of meaningless sex, and an American accent so diluted now it sounds like a Bangladeshi used car dealer trying to sell a Hyundai Santro by saying "it have all working, bhai."

I also came back with bipolar disorder, a mild porn addiction, an unhealthy relationship with the sound of my own piss stream (louder = healthier, don’t @ me), and an unplaceable sadness that sits somewhere between my kidneys and the last unread novel on my shelf. I reread page 17 of every book. Never finish.

Here’s the science again. The anterior cingulate cortex is partially responsible for decision-making, empathy, and the motivation to move your fucking legs. In MRIs of severely depressed individuals, this region glows like a dead Christmas light bulb at a government office. Nobody replaces it. It just blinks once in a while out of habit.

I am powered by blinking dead bulbs and a tea pan that squeals like a molested banshee when it boils.

That pan is older than my last orgasm. Possibly more meaningful too. Because that whistle, fuck me, it’s the only thing around here that screams when it’s hurt. I just fart silently and scroll.

What do I scroll? Everything. Nothing. Tweets. Threads. Diagrams of serotonin pathways. Pictures of women I once thought I might have loved. A YouTube video about the urachus, which is a remnant duct between your bladder and navel that sometimes doesn’t close properly in men and causes piss to leak from your belly button. You think you’re depressed? Imagine leaking piss from your stomach. I’d at least *feel* something.

Now, death. Death would simplify shit.

No passwords. No backups. No awkward attempts to explain my final Google search (“is it possible to overdose on saffron?”). No fucking to-do list with “Buy curd. Don’t die. Update CV.”

But unlike death, depression lets you *simmer.* You sit in your own stock, turning into a consommé of guilt and flatulence. Nobody buries you. You just recede. Like my hairline. Or democracy. Or foreplay.

People call. You don’t pick up.

People stop calling. You feel abandoned.

You want love. But if someone shows up, you panic and pretend you’re fasting for spiritual reasons and can't meet today, even though you're literally eating leftover bhindi with your fingers while scratching your crotch with the other hand.

People tell you to go outside. Walk. Touch grass.

Grass? The only thing green around here is the fungal patch under my pillow.

And outside? Outside is men with loud voices who think YouTube counts as a degree, women who clutch handbags like they contain the last vial of human decency, and scooters ridden by screaming toddlers who will one day be adults with voting rights and erectile dysfunction.

I used to read. I used to fuck. I used to think things mattered. Now I mostly nap.

The other day I tried to jerk off but fell asleep midway and woke up four hours later with a semi, a numb left leg, and an ad for cremation services playing on autoplay.
