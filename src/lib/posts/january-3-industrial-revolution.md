The first thing I misremembered this morning sitting inside a long power outage wasn’t birdsong or the municipal chorus of coughing scooters, but that low, steady bass-note you only get from large machines pretending to be calm—like a generator the size of a small apartment, humming behind a perimeter wall in New Town, the so-called cloud made audible as a vibration in my tea glass.

Outside my own unfashionable fringe of South Calcutta, winter has that dry, bureaucratic light—pale, official, as if the sun has filed the proper forms in triplicate and will now shine in the approved wavelength band. I stood at the window with a steel tumbler warming my fingers, watching a thin line of smoke lean sideways over the rooftops, and my phone flashed an OTP like a tiny electronic sneeze. One-time password. One-time permission. One-time proof that I exist in the correct way, at the correct time, to the correct server.

We used to have revolutions you could see. You could point at a chimney, a steam engine, a loom, a railway line slicing through a field like a fresh scar. Now the revolutions arrive as interfaces—portals, dashboards, “boards,” compliance checklists, grievance systems, authorisation screens. If the old Industrial Revolution was soot on your face, the new one is an email with the subject line: ACTION REQUIRED.

So yes, people keep counting them—First, Second, Third, Fourth—but the counting is always a little dishonest, the way we label drawers after the house has already become a mess. The first upheaval was steam and coal and the invention of the factory as a kind of moral technology: you could replace a craftsman with a timetable. The second was electricity and the assembly line, the great multiplication trick—one design, infinite copies, with human beings pressed into the rhythm like punctuation marks. The third was computation and networks and container ships and global supply chains, where work got abstracted into software and logistics and the polite euphemism of “efficiency.” And the fourth—this current glossy layer—is the fusion of sensors, models, automation, and always-on connectivity: machines watching machines, decisions happening at machine-speed, and the human reduced to a user, an exception-handler, a liability with feelings.

In the middle of that mental machinery I found myself listening to “O Amar Moyna Go,” and the song did what old songs do best: it refused to be a diagram. It pulled me out of spreadsheet logic—carbon here, compliance there, permission everywhere—and dropped me into a softer, older physics where a voice can carry a whole village’s weather inside it. Moyna: the myna bird, glossy and talkative, an organic imitator perched on a wire—an early chatbot with feathers and better manners. There’s something almost indecent about hearing that sweetness while thinking about Industry 4.0, because the song comes from a world where communication was breath and distance, not packets and protocols; where “network” meant cousins and neighbors; where the future arrived as marriages, floods, bus routes, not as a blinking OTP and a data-centre wall humming like captive thunder. And yet the overlap nags me: the myna repeats what it hears, the model repeats what it has ingested, and in both cases we humans can’t resist mistaking mimicry for understanding—then getting sentimental about it, as if a convincing imitation of love is the same thing as love.

Everyone keeps calling this the “Fourth,” and I keep wanting to behave like a responsible adult and accept the numbering system, but numbering systems are always someone else’s way of disciplining your confusion. A Bengali boy grows up learning that history is a tidy sequence—Mauryas, Mughals, British, freedom, progress—like chapters in a well-behaved textbook that never mentions the smell of the classroom fan’s hot dust. Real life isn’t chapters. It’s strata.

That’s the sensation India gives me now: not one era, but layers piled badly, like a landlord’s renovation. Steam-age institutions still run the shop—paper files, rubber stamps, the sacred aura of a babu’s signature. Patchy electrification hums underneath—transformers that sizzle in summer, “load shedding” that sounds like a polite haircut but is actually a small civic amputation. Digitization sits atop it like cheap paint—apps that crash, portals that time out, QR codes stuck on walls that lead nowhere. And then, gleaming above all that, the AI layer: glossy, imported, marketed like a skin cream. *Now with intelligence.*

Intelligence. The word makes me laugh and wince in the same motion, like biting a guava seed.

Somewhere far away—Brussels, Washington, Geneva, the high priesthoods with clean sidewalks—policy has decided that carbon is no longer a gas you exhale and forget. Carbon is a customs form. Carbon is a border. Carbon is an invoice line-item. Emissions are being turned into paperwork the way the British once turned land into survey maps: measure it, name it, tax it, and call that civilization. You can almost admire the audacity. You can also notice who gets squeezed when virtue is priced.

I picture an exporter—some tired man with a calculator and a face that has learned to look optimistic for bankers—staring at a spreadsheet where “green compliance” isn’t a moral awakening but a margin problem. He doesn’t trim executive bonuses. He trims wages. This is how high ideals travel through supply chains: they arrive as pressure.

And while carbon becomes customs, AI becomes compliance. “Codes of practice,” “safety cases,” “transparency templates”—the modern equivalents of scripture, except the priests are consultants and the temples are PDF files. The phrase “voluntary” will be used, of course. “Voluntary” is one of those words—like “flexible” or “restructuring”—that means the powerful have already decided, and you are being invited to agree.

Meanwhile, here in my actual day, rights are also becoming portals. Data protection, privacy, consent—beautiful words, clean words, words that sound like the best parts of liberal democracy—are being operationalized into forms, boards, complaint systems, “mechanisms.” I can almost hear the nation sigh in relief: *Good, good, we have a mechanism.* We love mechanisms because they allow us to stop thinking about outcomes.

In practice, consent often feels like that blinking red light on a biometric scanner: the machine is either satisfied or it isn’t, and your year hangs on the mood of an LED. Meritocracy—this imported fairy tale we recite to our children while pushing them into coaching centres—now depends on stable lighting and reliable servers. A mismatch, a network hiccup, a smudged thumb, and the system looks at you the way a nightclub bouncer looks at a boy in cheap shoes.

Outside the coaching centre, the posters promise “future skills.” Inside, everyone is learning the oldest skill on earth: how to survive a gate.

The strangest part is how the new scarcity isn’t always silicon or power or even talent. It’s permission.

Permission to ship a chip. Permission to access a tool. Permission renewed annually, like a license for existence. The world is drifting into a kind of toll economy where sovereignty is expressed not as flags and speeches but as “approved customers,” “annual renewals,” “fees.” Empire by calendar invite. Geopolitics as subscription service.

And then there’s the electricity, the great unpoetic god we all worship while pretending we don’t. Data centres—those windowless fortresses of computation—have the charm of bureaucratic buildings and the appetite of mythological demons. They eat electrons, they drink water, they exhale heat. They arrive with press releases about being “AI-ready,” and behind the press releases are diesel gensets, backup politics, land deals, security guards who become the true interface to prosperity. A guard is always the interface in India, when you think about it. You can have the most modern system in the world, but first you must pass a human being sitting on a plastic chair, deciding whether you belong.
 
And I have this premonition—half superstition, half pattern-recognition—that load-shedding is going to become more frequent in Calcutta, not because we suddenly got poorer (we’ve always been poor in the ways that matter) but because the priority list will quietly change: the lights will blink out in living rooms while the racks stay fed, “critical infrastructure” will come to mean servers, not human throats, and potable water—our most intimate, unglamorous requirement—will be siphoned off for cooling loops and industrial thirst, leaving the rest of us to improvise like we always do, boiling, storing, bargaining, pretending it’s normal because the app still loads. And then the deeper fear, the one that doesn’t announce itself with sirens: as more and more groundwater is pulled out without being replenished, subsidence won’t be a rare headline or a strange geological footnote, it’ll be the default condition—slow, quiet settling, the city sinking by millimeters the way hope sinks by disappointments—and we won’t need an earthquake to learn what a crack looks like; our houses will start writing their own little fault lines, polite at first, hairline and deniable, then wider, then suddenly impossible to explain away as “just the plaster,” as if plaster has ambitions of its own.

Software, too, has become layered. Once there was Software 1.0—handwritten code, the kind you could read like prose if you were masochistic enough. Then came Software 2.0—models trained from data, weights congealed into something that behaves like a statistical instinct. Now we have Software 3.0—prompts as programs, language as a steering wheel. The next thing—whatever we call it, 4.0 or 3.7 or “agentic workflows” (a phrase that sounds like it was invented by a committee of tired futurists)—will be semi-autonomous coworkers you supervise, audit, and occasionally distrust.

A foreman with better grammar.

People say this will make us more productive. I don’t doubt it will make *something* faster. Bureaucracy loves speed when it is rejecting you. “Faster processing” often means faster denial. In India, “digital” sometimes feels like the same old indifference, delivered with less eye contact.

And labor—always the quiet casualty in grand narratives—will be asked to adapt, to reskill, to be “agile,” to reinvent itself every quarter like a tech company’s branding deck. The missing first rung is the part that scares me most, not because I worship the dignity of entry-level jobs (I’ve met enough petty tyrants in junior positions to know that hierarchy reproduces itself at all ages), but because societies need ladders. A civilization that removes the first rung and then lectures the falling about “mindset” is not modern. It is cruel with Wi-Fi.

At College Street, you can still find old men bent over books as if the world’s noise is an optional subscription they never activated. There is tenderness in that, a stubborn, quiet refusal. Paper doesn’t ask for an OTP. A page doesn’t blink red at your thumb. A book will judge you only by whether you can read, and even then it will wait patiently while you learn.

I almost start to romanticize it—there’s the trope forming, the sentimental little lantern of “books will save us”—and I swat it away like a mosquito. Books don’t save us. Books merely make the darkness more articulate.

Still, I think about the layers again: steam, electricity, digitization, AI. Strata of progress, stacked unevenly, with cracks where the old infrastructure shows through. In the rich countries, the Fourth Revolution is marketed as fusion—cyber-physical systems, smart everything, seamless automation. Here, it sometimes feels like a new coating over old rot, and the rot is not just corruption or incompetence but the deeper habit of treating human beings as interruptions.

The misremembered imagined generator bass-note continued all day at the back of my skull, steady as a mantra, except this mantra didn’t promise liberation or moksha—only uptime.

At dusk the sky went the color of unwashed cotton, that familiar Kolkata compromise between beauty and particulate matter, and the red light on my phone’s screen lit my palm again—another code, another proof, another tiny petition to the machine-gods. Somewhere behind a wall, a diesel engine kept the cloud alive. The future, as ever, smelled faintly of fuel.
