There is a very specific aroma that wafts from aging AI laboratories—and yes, they age terribly fast, like bread left out in a monsoon. It’s a scent somewhere between ozone, warm plastic, and a mouse that passed away quietly behind the UPS battery backup. If you walk in at just the right moment on a mid-July afternoon in Calcutta, when the humidity hugs you like an overly affectionate aunt wearing a wool coat, you catch that scent in your nose and you realize with sudden, crystal clarity: *we are the help now.*

Everyone seems to be in a breathless panic about the year 2026, acting as if the entire Indian IT sector is going to simply vanish, like a sock in a dryer, the moment a computer learns to write a "Hello World" script without supervision. If you listen to the digital utopians in Silicon Valley—people who, I suspect, haven’t physically touched a light switch in years—you’d think we’re on the verge of a world where software simply wills itself into existence.

But if you strip away the shiny marketing and look at the actual, stubborn clumsiness of the real world, the answer is fairly obvious: Yes, the sector will survive. But it will survive in the way a cockroach survives a nuclear winter—by being small, efficient, and willing to eat the things no one else wants.

We have become the designated turners-off-and-on-ers of the machine.

To understand why, you have to ignore the people selling you the future and look at the sheer, unglamorous thermodynamics of the present. We tend to forget that software isn't magic dust; it lives on hardware, and hardware eats electricity. To replace the entire output of five million human beings with Artificial Intelligence would require a computational infrastructure that doesn’t actually exist yet.

There is a remarkable efficiency to people that we don't give enough credit to. Consider the human brain. It runs on roughly 20 watts of power. That is less than a dim lightbulb in a hallway you rarely visit. It runs on toast, tea, and the occasional compliment. Compare that to a rack of H100 GPUs running constant inference. The machines are loud, hot, and voraciously hungry. The energy arbitrage—the cost difference—doesn't overwhelmingly favor the machine for every task yet. It’s simply cheaper to hire a person to solve a complex, messy problem than to fire up a generator to let a robot guess at it.

And the robot *will* guess.

We call it "hallucinating," which is the polite term for when a computer lies to you with absolute confidence. This is where we come in. We are the "human-in-the-loop." We are the B-grade nannies of the digital age, gently guiding the bots before they enter the real markets, polishing their silicon shoes with turmeric-stained fingers, and insisting to ourselves that *this* is engineering.

Corporations are risk-averse. They are not going to hand over their core financial ledgers—ancient "spaghetti code" written decades ago by people who have long since retired to Florida—to an autonomous agent in 2026. This legacy code is a hoarder’s attic of logic. If you let a modern AI loose on it, it won't fix it; it will invent a new reality where 2 + 2 equals "Tuesday." So, the corporations will pay humans to watch the agents.

We were the world’s software architects once. Now, we are the custodial staff.

It turns out a fellow named Moravec discovered a paradox years ago that effectively said: "Computers are great at calculus, but terrible at folding laundry." It was a real *Eureka!* moment. They realized AI can reason, but it cannot climb stairs, or wiggle a cable, or dust the ventilation fans of a Tier 3 datacenter in Andhra Pradesh when the power cuts out because a squirrel martyred itself on the transformer.

So, who do they call? Us. The surplus opposable thumbs with bad posture and enough humility to wipe down the server racks for a paycheck that wouldn't buy a decent bag of almonds in Delaware.

And then there is the Jevons paradox. As AI makes coding cheaper, we won’t produce less software; we will produce ten times as much. We will have software for our toasters, our socks, our pets. This explosion in volume will create a massive secondary demand for testing and maintenance. The sector won’t die; it will just become more dense.

It’s not exactly a decline; it’s a *reassignment*. A pretend economy of busy work around smart objects. Because it turns out the machines don’t hate us. They just don't *need* us. And if they don’t need us, nobody else will pretend to.

So we shift from writing boilerplate code to becoming the editors, the chaperones ensuring the AI doesn't embarrass the company.

Do you know the worst part? I still wake up some days and open my code editor like it matters. I still search online for "how to use async Python," pretending to *learn*, as if there is a ladder somewhere that hasn’t already been pulled up by a smiling algorithm that doesn’t get tired, doesn’t get hungry, and doesn’t think it's clever for still remembering Linux commands in 2026.

And in that moment, in that humiliating pretense of participation, I understand religion. I understand why people chant. Why they try to reach across the void and believe someone is listening. Because sometimes, the only thing keeping you from screaming on the datacenter floor is the faint, foolish hope that your prayers to the Algorithm might result in a callback.

They won't. But you’ll chant anyway.

I chant too. Usually while boiling eggs in my tea pan—because who has time for dishes?—trying not to weep because the last client fired me for not being "emotionally invested" in the group chat.

Sir, I *live* in this group chat. I exist here. I wither here.

But I am not the engineer anymore. I am just the guy who holds the door open for the robot. And the robot never even says thank you.
