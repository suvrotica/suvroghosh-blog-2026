There is a very specific aroma that wafts from aging AI laboratories—and yes, they age terribly fast, like bread left out in a monsoon. It’s a scent somewhere between ozone, warm plastic, and a mouse that passed away quietly behind the UPS battery backup. If you walk in at just the right moment on a mid-July afternoon in Calcutta, when the humidity hugs you like an overly affectionate aunt wearing a wool coat, you catch that scent in your nose and you realize with sudden, crystal clarity: *we are the help now.*

They don’t really need us to think anymore.

Not really.

Not unless you call "thinking" the act of pretending to work while actually just being a mediocre chaperone for a chatbot. We have become the B-grade nannies of the digital age, gently guiding the bots before they enter the real markets, polishing their silicon shoes with turmeric-stained fingers, and insisting to ourselves that *this* is engineering. *This* is contribution. *This* is future-proof. Meanwhile, a plugin written by a teenager in Prague quietly undoes our entire career in six seconds flat.

I am what happens when your country trains you to write code, then replaces you with the very thing you trained to replace you, and now expects you to pantomime "productivity" just believably enough that the customer doesn’t notice they’re paying twelve dollars an hour for AI output they could have generated themselves if they weren’t such technophobes.

This is the new export economy: we are the designated turners-off-and-on-ers of the machine.

And to be fair, the machine lives in a very nice room. It has central air conditioning.

It turns out a fellow named Moravec discovered a paradox years ago that effectively said: "Computers are great at calculus, but terrible at folding laundry." It was a real *Eureka!* moment. They realized AI can reason, but it cannot climb stairs, or wiggle a cable, or dust the ventilation fans of a Tier 3 datacenter in Andhra Pradesh when the power cuts out because a squirrel martyred itself on the transformer.

So, who do they call? Us. The leftover humans. The backup plan. The surplus opposable thumbs with bad posture and enough humility to wipe down the server racks for a paycheck that wouldn't buy a decent bag of almonds in Delaware.

We were the world’s software architects once. Now, we are the custodial staff.

Or worse: The *Sentimental Backup*.

You know what survives after all the knowledge work is automated? Physical maintenance and forced empathy. And we are terrible at empathy. We are too tired. So, all that’s left is to market our ability to be physically present. To stand in the room. To verify that the blinking lights are, in fact, blinking.

The American customer has caught on.

Slowly, dimly, but they have caught on. They realize that what they are buying from "DevShankar Solutions" is not handcrafted code, but a glorified internet search pasted into a Word doc with some bullet points and a fake Jira comment ("Team evaluating scope..."). The only reason the executive doesn't weep openly is that he’s using the same AI to read the reports.

And now, the customer wants a refund.

But the refund goes to the bot. The bot doesn’t need you. It doesn’t need your visa, or your tea breaks, or your promises to "circle back."

No, you will do HVAC maintenance. You will change the filters at the new Hyperscale Facility, hosed down every three hours, trained to distinguish between the sound of a cooling fan and the sound of a dying hard drive. You are living proof of the techno-dream: *From Software Engineer to Air Conditioner Technician in three decades flat.*

This is our golden future. And it smells like warm copper and floor wax.

It’s not exactly a decline; it’s a *reassignment*. A pretend economy of busy work around smart objects. Because it turns out the machines don’t hate us. They just don't *need* us. And if they don’t need us, nobody else will pretend to.

And if nobody pretends, the illusion shatters.

And if the illusion shatters, it’s just a bunch of us in Salt Lake City, calling ourselves "AI Enablement Strategists," hoping the client doesn’t notice we forgot to remove the "Generated by..." watermark from the final deliverable.

Do you know the worst part?

I still wake up some days and open my code editor like it matters.

I still write snippets of code I’ll never test. I still search online for "how to use async Python," pretending to *learn*, as if there is a ladder somewhere that hasn’t already been pulled up by a smiling algorithm that doesn’t get tired, doesn’t get hungry, and doesn’t think it's clever for still remembering Linux commands in 2026.

And in that moment, in that humiliating pretense of participation, I understand religion.

I understand why people chant.

Why they pray.

Why they try to reach across the void and believe someone is listening.

Because sometimes, the only thing keeping you from screaming on the datacenter floor is the faint, foolish hope that your prayers to the Algorithm might result in a **callback**.

They won't.

But you’ll chant anyway.

I chant too. Usually while boiling eggs in my tea pan—because who has time for dishes?—trying not to weep because the last client fired me for not being "emotionally invested" in the group chat.

Sir, I *live* in this group chat. I exist here. I wither here.

But I am not the engineer anymore.

I am just the guy who holds the door open for the robot.

And the robot never even says thank you.
