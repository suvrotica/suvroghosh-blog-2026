The first thing I notice is the **smell**, because humiliation always announces itself through the nose before the brain gets a vote, a warm ammoniac fog rising from my own boxers as I squat on a chipped ceramic throne that has seen more ideological regimes than Iran has had slogans, the fan above me clicking like an asthmatic metronome, my knees trembling not from age—though yes, age too—but from the simple animal dread that somewhere on the planet men with batons and beards and uniforms are beating the shit out of other men and women because God told them to, or the flag did, or the Constitution in drag, and here I am evacuating breakfast with the dignity of a dying goat, scrolling news with one hand, wiping with the other, trying not to smear history across my thigh.

Iran today looks like a **theology wearing steel-toed boots**, and I know that sentence sounds clever until you imagine the boots actually on your ribs, your spine doing that humiliating accordion thing, your mouth filling with coppery spit that tastes like old coins and regret, which is how power always tastes when it finally touches flesh, never like ideals, always like blood diluted with piss, and the thing that fries my already overcooked neurons is how every single regime everywhere does this little ventriloquist act where God throws his voice into the general’s mouth and democracy throws hers into a press release, and both swear they’re doing it for you, my sweet citizen, my beloved cunt, please lie still.

I’m fifty-something, my body a badly maintained colonial railway station with broken clocks and leaking pipes, and I’ve lived long enough to see God change costumes more often than I change my bedsheets, sometimes he’s a bearded Persian patriarch glaring down from billboards, sometimes he’s a clean-shaven corporate deity speaking English with a think-tank accent, sometimes he’s just a spreadsheet with missiles attached, but the choreography is the same: first the chant, then the truncheon, then the apology written by lawyers while someone else hoses the sidewalk.

People keep asking why Iranians protest, as if starvation and humiliation require a fucking syllabus, as if the human nervous system hasn’t already published its findings: squeeze long enough and something kicks back, even worms do it, and worms don’t even have Twitter, and when they do kick back the state reacts the way all insecure gods react—by turning up the volume on punishment—because power, stripped of poetry, is just a scared animal with paperwork.

Democracy, that other holy word we masturbate over, doesn’t escape my bile either, because I’ve watched it used like talcum powder on a corpse, sprinkled generously while the body rots underneath, and yes I know, I know, democracy is supposed to be better, less murderous, more accountable, but from down here, from the level of cracked heels and public toilets and bus rides where you’re trying to hide a semi because the seat vibrates just wrong, democracy often feels like **God with better branding**, still distant, still selective, still perfectly capable of deciding you’re an acceptable casualty in the footnotes.

My tea pan screams from the kitchen—not a kettle, mind you, not one of those polite British contraptions that whistle like a governess farting through lace, but a scorched steel bastard of a pan with a bent handle and burn rings older than some democracies, a pan that doesn’t whistle so much as it howls, shrill and sharp like an underpaid typist watching her pension get looted again, and as the shriek slices the stale air, I remember how the British taught half the fucking world to queue while being robbed blind, how they exported red tape and railways and a kind of moral rectal blockage that passes for order even when it’s suffocating you, and Iran, India, whatever-the-fuck—everywhere that once took tea in china cups while swallowing empire through a sugar cube—we’re still constipated with those systems, still farting imported bureaucracy and shitting out local tyrants while lighting incense and calling it culture.

The science of it is depressingly simple: power centralizes because entropy loves a shortcut, neurons cluster, gangs form, hierarchies solidify, and once you give a system permission to hurt in the name of something abstract—God, Nation, Security—it will do so with the enthusiasm of a toddler discovering fire, and the data is written in scar tissue, not journals, which is why no one reads it until it’s their own skin doing the learning.

Sometimes I imagine the state as a gigantic colon, absorbing nutrients, excreting dissent, flexing rhythmically, and the people as gut bacteria, necessary but disposable, occasionally flaring up into diarrhea that embarrasses the organism into action, and the remedy is always the same: clamp down, medicate, suppress, never ask why the diet is shit in the first place.

Iran’s streets, from what leaks through blackouts and censorship like sewage through cracked pipes, look like any other place where belief has metastasized into policy, young bodies running, old men ordering, slogans colliding with skulls, and somewhere a bureaucrat adjusting his tie while signing off on violence with the detached calm of someone choosing paint colors, and the part that keeps me awake—between piss breaks and useless erections—is how universal this is, how easily the script translates, Persian to Hindi to English to whatever language your oppressor prefers.

I don’t believe in God, not in the supernatural sense, but I absolutely believe in **the god-function**, that neurological hack where we outsource responsibility upward so we can sleep at night, and regimes love that function because it turns murder into liturgy, batons into sacraments, prisons into temples where the faithful are purified by suffering, and dissent becomes heresy, which is much easier to punish than disagreement.

Democracy, when it works, is supposed to short-circuit that god-function, to say no one gets divine immunity, but it’s fragile, boring, maintenance-heavy, like flossing or monogamy, and humans hate maintenance, we prefer grand gestures and flags and fuck-you fireworks, so we let it rot, then act surprised when the rot smells like Iran today or like any other place where the state decides your body is a rounding error.

My own body, traitorous sack of fluids, reminds me of this every morning when joints creak like old doors and digestion feels like a hostile takeover, autonomy reduced to negotiating with organs that don’t respect ideology, and maybe that’s why all this shit hits so close to the bladder: because the most honest politics is physiology, who gets to eat, who gets to move, who gets to shit without fear of a boot bursting in.

I picture a young Iranian kid, phone shaking, hiding in a stairwell, heart jackhammering, bladder screaming, democracy and God both equally absent in that moment, replaced by the very real calculus of escape velocity and pain thresholds, and I want to tell him nothing comforting, nothing redemptive, because lies are cheap and bullets are not, but I can’t tell him anything anyway, my words stuck here, leaking into this screen, another middle-aged bastard shouting into the algorithmic void while power does what it’s always done.

The tea goes cold. My boxers ride up. The fan keeps clicking. Somewhere, a god in riot gear lifts his baton and calls it order, somewhere else a pundit calls it complexity, and here I am, half-hard for no good reason, trying to stand up without my knees sounding like gunfire, thinking the bleakest joke of all is that none of this is new, none of it is surprising, and we’ll all act shocked again tomorrow, wiping our hands, flushing, pretending the stench isn’t ours.
