It happens while I’m on the toilet, because of course it does, because my life has a gift for staging its little tragedies with my pants around my ankles, knees wide like a surrender flag, the winter air leaking through the bathroom window smelling of diesel and damp concrete and that particular Kolkata December perfume—smoke, dust, old marigolds, someone burning garbage like a devotional offering to the god of “not my problem”—and my phone is warm and greasy in my hand, and my body is doing its slow, humiliating work with the enthusiasm of a government clerk: stamp, sigh, push, postpone.

The comment lands with the weight of a dead mosquito: “This is least of the pollution problems, can’t breathe in December.”

That’s it. That’s the entire shove. A sentence so casual it should evaporate, but instead it threads itself into my nervous system like a hook, and suddenly the toilet is no longer a toilet, it’s the witness stand, and my anus is not an anus, it’s a trembling little mouth of truth being forced to testify in public, and my thumb—this traitor thumb—starts hovering over the keyboard like it’s about to administer justice.

Outside, the city is already noisy in that winter way, where sound travels cleaner and farther, like the air has been ironed flat and made into a better conductor for other people’s stupidity; a distant horn becomes a personal insult, a wedding DJ becomes a ceiling leak, a news channel at the neighbor’s house turns into an 8D surround sermon, and somewhere a backhoe is chewing the road again like it’s trying to find oil beneath my remaining sanity.

Inside, the real noise begins.

Here comes my inner Courtroom Announcer, throat cleared, robe adjusted, a bureaucrat of reputation with a laminated ID card and a stapler, who lives behind my eyes and pops up whenever someone minimizes me, which is depressingly often, and whose entire job description is: “Convert small social irritations into full-length trials.”

He loves a trial.

He loves the feeling of papers, forms, evidence, the little click of a gavel that exists only in my head. He wheels out imaginary spectators in rows—people who were never there, who will never care, who would step over my corpse to buy discounted fish—and he points to the comment like it’s Exhibit A and says, in a voice that would make a district judge yawn, “Ladies and gentlemen, we have been wronged.”

And then I do the thing I always do: I don’t answer the comment, I answer the sensation. I answer the old fear. I answer the historical archive of being talked over, laughed at, waved away, the experience of speaking in a room where everyone is louder, stupider, more confident, and somehow still invited to the microphone. I answer my own humiliation, and I treat it like logic.

The comment wasn’t even denying pollution. It was doing the Kolkata move: the Olympics of suffering. Your complaint is always downgraded by someone else’s worse complaint, like a sadistic customer support queue. Noise? “At least you have ears.” Road dust? “At least you have lungs.” Lungs? “At least you’re alive.” Alive? “At least you’re not me.” It’s a national sport, this competitive misery, and it pairs beautifully with our love of authority, which is basically the same sport but with uniforms.

So I start drafting.

In my head, first. Always first in my head, because my head likes to hold auditions. I write three replies, ten replies, a manifesto, a parliamentary speech, a cruel little haiku that would make him cry, and a polite, rational paragraph that would make him realize his error and apologize and invite me to a TED talk. I imagine the upvotes, the respectful silence, the person saying, “Sir, you are right,” as if the internet has ever produced that sentence in good faith.

The body keeps doing what bodies do. Sweat gathers at the small of my back. My gut cramps. The smell rises—me, human compost—while my mind insists it is engaged in civic discourse. This is the genius of rumination: it lets you cosplay as a philosopher while you are literally evacuating lunch.

Somewhere in this trance, libido shows up, because libido always shows up when it shouldn’t, like a drunk uncle at a funeral who insists on dancing. I’m fifty-something, my erections now come with paperwork and delayed processing, but still—shame has a way of stirring the worst parts of me. The comment makes me feel small, and my body responds with its old idiot strategy: prove you exist, prove you matter, prove you have force, even if the force is a pathetic semi that arrives like a reluctant guest and leaves before the tea is served.

You know the phrase “post-nut clarity”? It’s a lie. It’s post-nut paperwork. It’s the mind trying to re-enter civilization after it briefly turned itself into a drooling animal. Sometimes I’ll watch porn—not because it’s pleasurable, but because it’s predictable, like junk food for the lonely nervous system—and then afterward I sit there with my phone in my hand, disgusted, scrolling like a corpse with Wi-Fi, and I think: congratulations, you’ve masturbated to pixels while the city outside burns garbage and the lungs of children are turning into soot filters. Bhalo, hero.

And then a YouTube comment arrives and I’m suddenly a crusader again.

The Courtroom Announcer loves this pivot. He loves anything that feels like control. Rumination is control cosplay: the world won’t behave, so you replay it; you can’t win in reality, so you win in simulation; you can’t make the city quieter, so you make your inner dialogue louder until it drowns out everything else. It’s like trying to come while constipated: there’s effort, there’s strain, there’s a fantasy of release, and at the end you mostly just feel sore and angry and vaguely betrayed by your own plumbing.

Nationalism works the same way, which is why it fits this country like a cheap synthetic shirt that never breathes. Nationalism is the constipation of identity: you keep clenching around an idea of “us,” you call it strength, you call it purity, you call it pride, and meanwhile you’re just choking your own circulation and pretending the discomfort is virtue. Everybody looks heroic while quietly suffering from self-inflicted blockage.

My brain, being the overeducated idiot it is, tries to make it all dignified by putting Latin stickers on it. “Libido,” it whispers, “from the Latin meaning ‘to embarrass your ancestors.’” Total bullshit, obviously, but it feels true in my mouth, like a tasty lie. “Comment,” it adds, “from ‘com-mentum,’ meaning ‘together we ment,’ which is why strangers on the internet immediately start minting your shame into coin.” Also bullshit. My brain invents etymologies the way my body produces gas: constantly, unasked, and with tragic confidence.

The pollution itself—air and noise—sits there like the real problem, waiting patiently while I build an opera around my pride. December in Kolkata is a laboratory experiment in inversion: the cold air hugs the ground, the exhaust can’t rise, so it collects like a low ceiling of poison, and we all walk around pretending it’s “mist,” as if the city is romantic instead of chemically insulting. You can taste the air sometimes, that metallic burn at the back of the throat, the faint headache that feels like someone tightening a belt around your skull. Add the construction dust, the honking, the loudspeakers, the studios full of fluorescent-jacketed anchors screaming adulterated news as if decibels were content, and the whole city becomes a throat clearing that never ends.

So yes, “can’t breathe in December” is not wrong. It’s just… irrelevant to the way the comment hits. Because the comment isn’t about air, it’s about hierarchy. It’s a tiny shove that says: your point is small, you are small, sit down. And my nervous system hears that and flips into an ancient mode, older than ideology: don’t be minimized.

That fear has history. Not colonial history in the grand museum sense, but the small colonialism of daily life: the way certain voices assume they’re the center, the way certain bodies take up space like entitlement is a birthright, the way I—book-fed, tea-stained, awkward—have spent decades trying to be taken seriously in rooms where seriousness is confused with volume. The British left, but the social mechanisms stayed, like bad plumbing in an old house. Even now, the city is layered with status like soot: who can complain, who must swallow, who gets called “sensitive,” who gets called “practical,” who gets told to adjust, always adjust, adjust until you disappear.

And so I keep typing in my head. I imagine writing: “Yes, December air is toxic, but noise is also pollution—sleep deprivation is real—stress hormones—cardiovascular risk—” and my inner Announcer nods, pleased, because he loves citations, he loves the fantasy of being unarguably correct, he loves the idea that logic will win. He is like those men who think women can be convinced into desire with a well-structured argument. He has never met a human nervous system, despite living inside one.

Meanwhile my body is still here. My stomach gurgles. A fart escapes—small, sad, like a footnote. I scratch my groin like a miserable ape. I remember, with the kind of intrusive cruelty my memory specializes in, an old crush from years ago—her smell, her indifferent kindness, the way my desire sat in my chest like a trapped animal—and I feel the familiar sting: I couldn’t close that deal, couldn’t be that man, couldn’t be normal, and so I became this: a middle-aged Bengali brain in a cramped flat, arguing with strangers while my erection fails like a power cut.

The Courtroom Announcer tries to rescue my dignity with scripture, because nothing says “rationalist” like using the Gita as a meme when you’re desperate. “कर्मण्येवाधिकारस्ते,” he whispers—only your right is to action—like it’s a motivational poster, like it’s not being used right now to justify me typing paragraphs into the void while my ass goes numb on a toilet seat.

Action. Sure. Here’s action: my thumb wants to hit “Reply.” My thumb wants the little dopamine pellet of sending. My thumb wants to feel like it did something, like it defended me, like it stood up in court and delivered the closing argument that makes the jury gasp. My thumb wants a win-condition that does not exist.

That’s the trick of the thread: it offers a slot machine of dignity. Maybe you’ll say the perfect thing. Maybe strangers will applaud. Maybe your status will rise by three imaginary points. Maybe you’ll finally get the respect you never got from the world that mattered. And maybe my erections will return, my youth will return, my city will become breathable, my father’s generation will stop voting like it’s a village feud, my neighbors will stop blasting music like they’re paid by the decibel, and my body will stop betraying me at random.

Maybe. Maybe. Maybe.

And every “maybe” costs me. It costs mood, quietly. Rumination is not dramatic; it’s administrative. It’s a tax. It’s the brain running a background process that eats RAM until everything slows down and even tea tastes flat. The longer I stay in it, the heavier I get, like I’m carrying a wet blanket made of unfinished arguments.

So I do the only dignified thing available, which is not grand and not inspiring and not clean. I close the tab.

Not with a flourish. Not with enlightenment. Just a dry little swipe, like brushing away a fly. The Courtroom Announcer sputters—objection!—but I ignore him the way you ignore a neighbor’s TV when you finally accept you can’t fight every noise. I stand up, my knees creak, my underwear clings with sweat, my half-erection evaporates into embarrassment, and I do a small physical task that has no audience and no applause: I bend down and inspect the melodramatic turds I have shit and inhale the incense of madness like a madman.

Then I walk past the window, see the December air sitting there like a dirty curtain, hear somebody’s bass thumping through concrete like a heartbeat I didn’t consent to, and I feel, briefly, the old itch to go back and reopen the tab, to argue my way into existence.

My hand twitches.

I scratch my groin instead.
