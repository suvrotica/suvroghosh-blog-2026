I don’t give a flying fuck about anything anymore, I said, and then I drew what was left of my dignity: my phimosis-turtledick, complete with angry little wings and those aren’t feet, those are my balls—two speckled, itty-bitty nuts squatting under the ballooned disaster of foreskin like guilty witnesses at a suicide. The thing looked like a depressed paratha that got molested by a squid and grew antennae just to express its despair. I call it “the Flying Snout.” My mother used to say God gives everyone a gift. I got this: a dick that looks like it’s sucking its thumb.

I’ve had phimosis since puberty. Not the cute “tight foreskin” variety either—no, this is full-on bloated snout territory. When aroused (which is rare and pathetic, like a crippled dog limping toward a fire hydrant), it balloons out like one of those chewy Japanese fish cakes, surging forward with all the confidence of a motherfucker who thinks he’s in a hentai. But the moment you try to peel it back—nope, party’s over. The whole thing yelps and retreats. I once tried forcing it open with coconut oil and a desperate hard-on. I screamed so loud my neighbor’s kid asked if aunty had died.

And then there’s the sack. Not majestic, not even ugly-hot. Just… small. Like the factory ran out of ball-flesh and gave me the free sample size. Wrinkled like depression, droopy like this country’s broadband, and yet, inexplicably, fuzzy in winter like they’re trying to hibernate. If I had a lover—which I don’t, let’s not kid ourselves—she’d think I’d grafted two litchis onto my groin using spirit gum.

I drew all of this in glorious stippled detail last night with the ceiling fan sputtering and some piss-colored LED light buzzing above like a mosquito with arthritis. Because art is what lonely cunts do when there’s no one left to fuck or call. I wasn’t horny. I was curious. “What does shame look like?” I asked, and my dick, ever the performer, said “Me, bitch.”

I’ve always had this strange horror of my body. When I was twelve, a girl at school said I looked like a mushroom if mushrooms had dandruff and bad breath. I didn’t talk to women again till 24, and even then, it was by accident. Most of my adult erotic life has been solo, silent, and internet-buffered. You start with porn, of course—first the tasteful ones with soft moaning and slick thighs, then the weirder shit: lactation, femdom, hentai tentacles, gaping. Then one day you’re watching a woman fart into a mason jar and wondering if the soul left your dick somewhere in the early 2000s. Spoiler: it did.

There was one girl. Years ago. Big eyes. She once said I looked like a “sad owl” and kissed me out of pity. Her tongue was warm and smelled faintly of tamarind. I was too afraid to tell her that I couldn’t retract my foreskin. So I avoided sex like a coward and eventually ghosted her with some drivel about my “career.” I jerked off about her for six months straight. The fantasy always ended before insertion. My dick would swell, but the snout refused. Even in fantasy, I had no entry.

Now at fifty-three, with back pain and three hemorrhoids like tiny protestors on my asshole, I’ve stopped pretending. I sit on the floor in my lungi, fart freely, scratch my pubes with a pen, and sometimes—on real low days—I talk to my dick. Not dirty talk. Not encouragement. More like, “What the fuck are you even good for anymore?” He doesn’t answer, because he’s a snouted little cunt who knows he’s guilty.

And I swear to fuck, the drawing is accurate. I didn’t embellish. The wings came later, of course. Artistic license. But even those are accurate in spirit: limp, veined, and flapping pointlessly like the shredded petticoat of a dead drag queen. If you squint, it looks like a bat with body dysmorphia. If you zoom in, it looks like what happens when shame learns to fly.

Meanwhile, society thunders outside. Men with chest hair and confidence. Women with clean fingernails and functioning noses. People who fuck. People who believe. People who jog at dawn, or work for startups, or have children who still talk to them. I sit in my room, drawing my malformed prick and wondering whether the sound I just made was a fart or something that needs medical attention.

I’ve had gas since 4:15 a.m. It’s now 9. Still going strong. The air smells faintly of boiled eggs and betrayal. I haven’t left the house in four days. I haven't spoken to a woman in three months unless you count customer service. I do not shave. I do not shine. I do not give a flying fuck. I am the last man on Earth who remembers the internet before porn tubes. I am the ghost of dial-up erections.

My doctor—who once touched my scrotum with a pencil and said “hmm”—told me I could get a circumcision, but I’d have to stop smoking and lose weight first. I told him I’d rather die snouted than live jogged. He laughed. I didn’t.

And so I remain. A winged, wrinkled, swollen little man, drawing his own dick because no one else will. There is no metaphor here. Or maybe there is, and it’s just too ashamed to show itself.

Sometimes when I shit—truly shit, with effort, with grunting, with prayers—I feel more alive than when I orgasm. The body knows. It says, “Look, at least something’s leaving you.”

The other night, I had a dream that my penis detached itself, grew legs, and ran away squealing like a baby piglet. I didn’t chase it.
