I drew it while my stomach was making that wet, treasonous bubbling sound that means the next ten minutes belong to gravity and shame, and I was perched on the toilet like a condemned man, sweating in winter because my body has never understood the concept of seasons, only panic. The sketch is a fat little winged thing—part bird, part dumpling, part tumor with feathers—hovering in midair like it’s proud of itself, like it’s just discovered flight and also discovered that nobody gives a flying fuck about it, which is convenient because it is, in fact, the flying fuck.

It has wings that look like they were cut out of crumpled saree borders and then ironed by an incompetent angel with jaundice. It has this bulbous, stupid snout, like a baby hippo trying to do cunnilingus on the concept of meaning and failing, and two sad little feet dangling below, as if even the ground has refused custody. There’s a single eye that says: yes, I see you. And the rest of it says: and I still don’t care.

That’s the mood lately. Not anger, not passion, not even the good old Bengali hobby of complaining with artisanal precision. Just… a dimming. Like somebody turned down the saturation on my brain. Old North Calcutta in my memory was noisy too, but it had texture—brick, damp, old books, a chai stall’s cigarette cough, the bells of a tram like a tired librarian clearing his throat. South Calcutta where I’m marooned now is concrete and dust and the permanent feeling that everything is being “developed” by idiots with backhoes and no plan, and my body is developing too, but in the way mold develops.

I sit there and the toilet seat bites the underside of my thighs and I’m thinking about nothing and everything, which is the same thing when you’re this tired. I’m thinking about my guts, which have the political stability of a small Latin American republic. One day they’re leftist, one day they’re rightist, one day they’re a coalition government that collapses at 3 a.m. and sends me running to the bathroom with my pants around my ankles like a man who has lost not only his dignity but his belt.

And then, because I’m a genius, because I’ve read too many fucking books and none of them taught me how to be a normal animal, I pick up a pen afterward and draw my spirit animal: the flying fuck. The most honest self-portrait I’ve done in years. Not heroic. Not tortured. Just… airborne and useless.

The thing is, I used to give a fuck. I gave too many fucks, like a slutty charity worker handing out condoms at a wedding. I gave a fuck about ideas. About truth. About rationality, which is a fancy word for “please can we stop lying to ourselves like toddlers.” I gave a fuck about politics until politics in this country became a kind of endless diarrhea—loud, public, sticky, and somehow always blamed on the person who points it out. I gave a fuck about being sharp, being useful, being the clever guy who could explain a confusion matrix with chalk and a good metaphor and maybe a stray joke. Now my confusion matrix is just: everything is confusing, and I’m losing.

The flying fuck has wings because apathy isn’t just sitting still. Apathy is active. It flaps. It travels. It migrates. It lands on your chest at night and squats there like a fat pigeon and you’re lying under a thin blanket, scrolling through porn you don’t even want, not because you’re horny but because you’re trying to feel anything at all, like a man poking a dead phone battery with a screwdriver going, come on, you cunt, spark.

That’s the erotic shame part, the special spice of middle-aged failure: the body still remembers desire the way a war veteran remembers gunfire. The brain says, “We are above this.” The hand says, “Shut up, professor.” The penis says, “I might show up, I might not, don’t pressure me, I have meetings.” And then there’s the exact moment when the video is doing its ridiculous enthusiastic gymnastics—some well-lit stranger moaning like she’s being paid per decibel—and I’m there, hunched like a gargoyle, and my dick is offering the performance of a tired government clerk. Half-mast. Late. Unmotivated. A union problem. Sometimes it works, and it’s not victory, it’s just paperwork getting stamped. Sometimes it doesn’t, and then you’re sitting there with your stupid browser tabs and your stupid self and you feel the purest form of loneliness: not the absence of a lover, but the absence of even your own body cooperating with your delusions.

I miss the simple humiliations. I miss being young enough that failure had drama. Now it’s just logistics. Erectile dysfunction isn’t tragic; it’s like your ceiling fan making a new noise. You listen to it. You pretend it’s fine. You think about calling someone. You don’t call. You live under it.

The flying fuck in my sketch looks like it has antennae, like it’s tuning into some cosmic radio station where the only song playing is “Who Cares” on repeat. That’s my head these days. I watch the news and it’s the same studio hippos barking their adulterated headlines, their hair lacquered into helmets, their faces doing that fake urgent expression—wide eyes, tight mouths—as if urgency is a substitute for facts. Their voices spill out of neighbors’ televisions in stereo, in winter, when sound travels like gossip, and every apartment becomes a speaker cabinet for the nation’s daily bullshit. It’s like living inside a public announcement. You can’t escape it. The whole city is a megaphone and my skull is the tin can.

And I’m supposed to care. About which party said what, which leader visited which temple, which flag was waved with which hand. I’m supposed to be stirred like a pot of dal. But I’ve become a cold pan. Nothing sticks. Nothing sizzles. I just sit there and my brain makes a small fart noise of indifference.

Maybe that’s the real bodily metaphor: ideology is like digestion. You can claim you’re pure, but eventually the system takes in some crap and produces some crap. Every grand idea becomes literal shit, because it has to pass through human beings, and human beings are bags of bacteria with egos. Colonial history is just the world’s longest case of food poisoning: one group arrives, insists their cuisine is superior, forces everyone to eat it, and then acts shocked when the natives develop ulcers.

The British did many things, but one of their greatest gifts to us was a particular kind of shame: the shame of the body. The Victorian whisper: don’t mention it, don’t touch it, don’t admit it, don’t let anyone know you’re an animal. Meanwhile they were out there doing empire like it was a sex act—penetration, extraction, leaving a mess—and calling it civilization. We inherited the hypocrisy and upgraded it with jugaad. Now we have a society where everyone is both prudish and porn-soaked, both spiritual and corrupt, both offended and shameless, and the only honest thing is the sewage, which at least is upfront about what it is.

My own body has become my little empire. I conquer it daily with caffeine and spicy food and the delusion that I’m still twenty-five. Then it revolts. Acid reflux. Sweaty pits. A weird pain in the knee like a petty bureaucrat refusing to sign my walking permit. The skin on my feet cracks like old plaster. My armpits smell like a science experiment. My belly makes its own weather.

Sometimes I look at old photographs and I feel this stupid, inappropriate longing—not even for a person, but for a version of myself that could be aroused by life. Not just by a porn clip. A version that could see a woman in a market and feel that electric, terrifying pull of possibility, and not immediately imagine the whole humiliating chain of events: the awkward hello, the polite smile, the fantasy, the failure, the late-night masturbation, the regret, the browser history like a crime scene. Desire now is mostly memory plus bad habits. It’s like listening to an old cassette: the song is there, but it’s warped, and the tape gets stuck, and you end up pulling it out in tangled brown ribbons, swearing at a machine that doesn’t know you exist.

That’s why the flying fuck feels so accurate. It’s not just “I don’t care.” It’s “I don’t even have the energy to pretend I care.” It’s the death of performance. The end of my small internal theatre where I used to play the role of Smart Man With Opinions. Now I’m just a sweating body in a room, hearing someone else’s TV through the wall, smelling my own stale breath, and thinking about the fact that my spine is basically a stack of unreliable bookshelves.

And still, because the universe is a sadistic comedian, the horny defeat keeps coming back like a recurring character. The dream where I’m young again and some girl from school—always the same impossible composite of eyelashes and contempt—touches my hand, and I wake up with a half-erection and a full bladder, and I’m lying there like: really? This is what you brought back from the dead? Not ambition. Not joy. Just a tired boner and urine.

I shuffle to the bathroom, stepping over the invisible debris of my life—unread books, unwritten plans, the half-dead lust that lives in the corners like mildew—and I look at the sketch again, taped or tossed or just sitting there like an accusation. The flying fuck has wings, yes, but it also has that droopy, resigned face. It’s not soaring. It’s hovering, barely. Like a fat god of nothingness trying to stay airborne on fumes.

And I think: maybe this is it. Maybe this is the honest endpoint. Not enlightenment. Not peace. Just a chubby little creature flapping above the toilet, smelling faintly of sweat and disappointment, refusing to land anywhere because the ground is as stupid as the sky.

Then my stomach makes that sound again—glorp, a wet little prophecy—and I realize the only schedule I can still keep is my bowels, and even they are unreliable, and I stand there in my underwear, half-hard for no reason, holding a pen like it’s a weapon, and I feel the flying fuck inside me flap once, lazily, like a moth in a jar, and the day begins the way it always does: with my body announcing, in plain language, that it does not respect my thoughts.
