The first thing I notice is the mouth, not my own—though mine is always involved—but the mouth in the drawing, puckered and obedient, like a trained animal’s asshole-facing grin, the kind that says uff so holy to power or promise, the kind that leans forward with its tongue already wet, and my fingers smell of cheap ink and tea and yesterday’s rice cooker steam as I stare at it in this fucking room with its peeling paint and fan that sounds like a dying mosquito, and I think yes, this is the country, this is the job market, this is the ladder, rung by rung made of lips and spit and a practiced nod that says sir sir sir as if saying sir enough times will turn piss into promotion.

I live in South Calcutta now, poor suburban shanty with concrete dreams cracked like old teeth, old North Calcutta still clinging to my bones like a smell—fish, ink, arguments—and I cook most days because restaurants cost money and dignity, so I bake shit in an electric oven that smells faintly of burnt plastic and hope, rice cooker humming like a bureaucrat processing files slowly on purpose, tea pan blackened from years of boiling the same leaves into submission, and while the water comes up I scroll jobs that promise meritocracy in bullet points like a fucking religion, and every bullet is a lie, every point is a cunt, and the only thing they don’t list is the oral exam where you kneel and praise the manager’s mediocre ideas like they fell from the sky fully formed.

The sketch sits there, obscene but accurate, the hand grabbing the shaft of authority with the confidence of someone who’s practiced this move in elevators and conference rooms, and I remember the first time I learned the trick wasn’t to be right but to be agreeable, that correctness without deference is just masturbation—feels good alone, useless in public—and some HR woman with a smile like laminated paper told me I was “abrasive,” which is a polite word for didn’t lick enough ass, didn’t laugh at the right jokes, didn’t nod while someone explained my own work back to me with the confidence of a TED talk.

Sycophancy isn’t a moral failing here; it’s an infrastructure project, poured early, reinforced with caste and cash and the colonial hangover that taught us the shortest path to safety is obedience dressed as enthusiasm, and they’ll tell you it’s networking, they’ll say culture fit, they’ll say soft skills as if the skill isn’t being soft where it counts and hard only in private fantasies that end with you alone on the toilet scrolling and thinking of a life that didn’t involve this much bending.

Science, bless its filthy little heart, has words for this, because everything gets words eventually, even bullshit: status signaling, dominance hierarchies, grooming behaviors—primates pick ticks; we pick assholes—and somewhere a paper explains how flattery lights up reward circuits like sugar, how power enjoys mirrors that smile back, and I imagine the neurons in some boss’s head firing as a junior says brilliant sir, just brilliant, and the dopamine flows like chai, and I’m back at my tea pan, stirring leaves until they surrender color, thinking about Pavlov and Skinner and how we trained ourselves into this kennel.

Meritocracy is a bedtime story told to children who can afford books, a fairy tale with a LinkedIn profile, and in India it wears a kurta and speaks English with an accent imported in 1857, the British taught us the exam, the ranking, the list, and we perfected the workaround, because if the test can’t be passed, the examiner can be pleased, and pleasing is easier than thinking, easier than doing, easier than saying no when the no is correct but lonely.

The body knows this before the brain admits it. My stomach tightens in meetings even when I’m alone now, phantom rooms full of nodding heads, my asshole clenches like it’s anticipating a request, and the abstract idea of “career” becomes a bodily thing, a posture, a tilt of the neck, a smile held too long until the jaw aches, and you go home and piss and the piss smells of swallowed words.

I’ve watched it up close, the ritual, the way a room rearranges itself around power like furniture fleeing a fire, the way jokes land only when aimed upward, the way dissent gets coughed into a handkerchief and pocketed for later, and I’ve been the idiot in the corner thinking facts matter, thinking if I explain the mechanism—how systems fail when feedback is flattered into silence—someone will care, but the room wants comfort, not truth, wants the lullaby of agreement, and truth is a fart that clears the space.

Colonial history again, sorry, it always comes back like acid reflux. The babu learned to bow, the clerk learned to wait, the empire learned to rule by paperwork and permission, and we inherited the filing cabinet of the soul, where every impulse must be stamped approved by someone who enjoys being asked, and now the startup founder is the new sahib, hoodie replacing pith helmet, but the posture is the same, the mouth ready, the compliment rehearsed, the LinkedIn post praising “vision” that looks suspiciously like copying whatever Silicon Valley sneezed last quarter.

I draw because talking gets me in trouble, and the drawing is rude enough to say what I won’t at a dinner where everyone’s chewing loudly and praising someone who arrived in a German car, and the dick-nose in the sketch points the way upward, anatomically impossible but socially precise, and someone once told me art is subjective, but this isn’t art, it’s a map, and the map says here be tongues.

There’s sex in this only as absence, as failure, as a ghost with bad skin rubbing itself against ambition. Desire rerouted becomes praise; libido redirected becomes loyalty; the energy that should make you fuck becomes the energy that makes you flatter, and Freud would have a field day if he weren’t busy being wrong about everything else, but the metaphor holds: you can’t cum in a system like this, you can only nod until you chafe.

Politics, obviously. Leftist turned numb because the slogans sound like ads now, because every party discovered the same trick corporations did: flatter the base, lick the mood, tell people they’re great while fucking them sideways, and upward mobility becomes a raffle ticket sold by someone who insists everyone can win while pocketing the box, and if you complain you’re told to be positive, which is code for shut up and smile.

I think about merit like a muscle that atrophied because nobody used it, like reading on screens until the eyes forget depth, like cooking on gas until electric feels wrong—skills decay when the environment rewards something else, and we built an environment that rewards the ass-kisser, the yes-man, the chuckle fuck who laughs before the punchline lands, and then we’re shocked when nothing works, when bridges fall, when policies rot, when every meeting produces applause and zero outcome.

The sketch’s little hand gripping authority looks confident, practiced, and I recognize it in myself in ugly moments, the reflex to soften, to agree, to survive, because hunger teaches lessons faster than philosophy, and sometimes you nod because rent exists, because rice costs money, because the tea pan doesn’t fill itself with dignity, and I don’t pretend purity, I’ve bent, I’ve smiled, I’ve swallowed, and it tastes like shit every time.

The room smells now of overboiled tea and damp walls, and my phone buzzes with a message that begins Dear Sir, and my body responds before my brain, a little tightening, a readiness to be nice, to be useful, to be liked, and I hate that this is true, hate that the drawing isn’t just satire but autobiography, hate that upward mobility has an odor and it’s not ambition, it’s breath.

At night the fan clicks and I think about neurons again, about reinforcement schedules, how intermittent rewards hook harder than steady ones, how a compliment once in a while keeps you licking forever, and the system is elegant in its cruelty, a Skinner box with salaries, a maze where the cheese whispers your name, and somewhere a boss sleeps well convinced he earned it all on merit.

I end where I started, staring at the mouth in the sketch, obedient and hopeful, and I feel a small, stupid stirring—not arousal, not quite despair—just the urge to piss, the body reminding me it still has needs that don’t care about ladders, and I shuffle to the bathroom in the dark, careful not to wake the neighbors, and as I aim and sigh I think of all the mouths aimed upward, all the praise flowing like urine toward power, and I miss the bowl slightly, which feels about right.
