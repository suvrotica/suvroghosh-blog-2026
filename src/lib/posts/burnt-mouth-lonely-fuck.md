It starts with the tongue. That fat fucking traitor. 

Not the poetic tongue, not the mother tongue, not even the "I bit my tongue so I don't offend that limp-dicked committee of yes-men" tongue. No. I mean the wet, hairy, always-slightly-furred-like-a-hamster's-backside bastard curled inside my mouth, tasting nothing these days except morning bitterness and a suspicious iron tang like licking an old AA battery that spent too long in your cousin’s TV remote during load-shedding in the ’90s.

You’d think with all the years it spent flapping around inside my face, reading Bertrand Russell and Rimsky-Korsakov and burping out facts about fucking chlorophyll and Dirac's quantum squiggles to bore women at bus stops who already hate their lives—this tongue would've earned some prestige, some retirement, some say in the matter.

But no.

It just sits there now. Unused. Undesired. Burnt. Like the rest of me.



Look at that image again.

That’s not a scream. That’s not a yawn. That’s not even a mouth anymore. That’s what remains when your identity has been sucked out like marrow from a bone. A charcoaled gash carved into what once was a face—like if Goya sketched Edvard Munch after dropping acid in a Park Circus power outage.

That’s me.

I'm that mouth.

Giant, gaping, grotesque.

The kind of mouth you get when you’ve been talking into voids for 30 years—committee rooms, waiting rooms, visa offices, “feedback” sessions, “we’ll get back to you” emails, imaginary fucking podcasts in your head where you’re the guest *and* the host because no one else will listen unless you hand them a bribe or a blowjob.

A mouth so wide it becomes a cavern. And inside? Echoes. Dry. Rattling. Laced with memory-dandruff.

No wonder nothing tastes right. The bacteria have moved out. Even they’re tired.



I used to say things like “epistemology” in casual conversations, for fuck’s sake. Now I can’t even ask for change at the tea stall without the boy handing me two Mentos and an expression that says, “Why is this old naked mole-rat in boxers pretending to be alive?”

I am a burnt-out bullshit Bengali buffoon.

Repeat it.

Say it with me.

I am a burnt-out bullshit Bengali buffoon.

Because once you say it loud enough—like farting in a mosque—you realize it has a rhythm, a sort of poetry, like Shakespeare if he had haemorrhoids and a hangover and had to share a flat with a rotting paneer sandwich and four mosquitoes named “Hope,” “Future,” “Desire,” and “You Dumb Cunt.”



When I was young, I used to believe in science. Not the *career*, not the greasy ladder-climbing grant-sucking bureaucratic science where you write papers about things you secretly hope nobody reads. I mean the kind that blew your mind open—the kind that made your nipples tingle when you understood for the first time that the sun was a hydrogen fart burning itself into light, or that time slows down near black holes, like your Wi-Fi when porn is buffering on 1%.

But now?

Now my science is remembering when to take omeprazole so I don't shit blood.

Now my physics is limited to the torque required to stand up after sitting cross-legged too long on a toilet scrolling through tweets that make me want to piss on the whole species.

Now my chemistry is realizing that “depression” isn’t a neurotransmitter problem; it’s just the body understanding what the fuck is going on.

Entropy is not some cosmic abstraction.

Entropy is watching your face melt in the mirror while brushing your six remaining teeth, four of which are liars and two of which are Polish immigrants posing as molars.



The history of suffering is mostly men like me.

Unnecessary.

Ejaculated into the world by mistake, handed degrees like consolation prizes, then slowly turned into archives of unread PDFs, middle-aged boxers, and thick toenails.

I live in a country where truth is either shouted by assholes on prime time or muttered by broken bastards like me to their stainless-steel tea mugs at 2:37 AM. A country that teaches you everything matters—your caste, your sperm count, your degrees, your daughter's dowry rate—but where nothing actually changes except the thickness of the air and the smell of the drains.

And I’m supposed to find meaning?

In what?

In watching my own mouth become a parody?

In counting the veins on my dick because I’ve run out of people to hate and ideas to jerk off to?

Fuck that.

Fuck your enlightenment.

Give me rot. Give me stink. Give me that surreal burnt grin where the lips don’t meet and the laugh escapes like a diseased bat.



My body is now a filing cabinet of failed experiments.

I fart and it sounds like an existential thesis being rejected by a German philosopher. I piss sideways. I sneeze and my shoulder dislocates. My spine makes decisions independently like a rebellious Tamil film heroine.

And that mouth?

That giant cavernous howling void?

That's just the exit wound for all the truths I’ve tried to swallow for 30 years.

The truth that none of this matters.

The truth that I will die in this shanty flat surrounded by used cotton underwear, broken spoons, and a blood-pressure machine that beeps like a forgotten Tamagotchi every time I lie down.

The truth that the only thing I ever loved was the sound of my own thinking—and even that has started to bore me.



People say “don’t be so hard on yourself.”

Okay.

Let’s be soft then.

Let’s imagine that mouth is a vagina.

Now what?

Now it’s still ugly, it still doesn’t get kissed, and it still drools at night from one side.

Congratulations. You made it worse.



Anyway, today I tried screaming into a pillow but the pillow fought back. Absorbed it. Mocked it. Stayed fluffy.

So I bit my own arm instead.

It didn't bleed.

I think I’ve run out of blood.

Just like I’ve run out of people to tell my stories to. Or jokes. Or questions like, “What is the evolutionary function of sadness?” and “Why do I still keep my first toothbrush?” and “Is it true that black holes fart information in a way that violates the unitarity of quantum mechanics or am I just projecting again?”

There’s a dead lizard behind my rice cooker.

Been there three days.

I think I’ll name it "Purpose." 

They can send Pegasus if they want. The whole fucking alphabet agency orchestra—NSA, RAW, your local paranoid WhatsApp uncle, or whatever sweaty-palmed junior bureaucrat in a polyester shirt gets the unenviable assignment of wiretapping my bowels through my burner phone in South Calcutta—go ahead, motherfuckers. I hope they enjoy the full frequency spectrum of my existence. I hope they archive my rants and label them "national threat: self-loathing fartbag with literary delusions." Because if they're listening, here’s what they'll hear: me moaning about hemorrhoids that itch like Satan’s pinky finger on my sphincter, halitosis so rich and ancient it could be carbon-dated and sold as Harappan artifact breath, and a lingering whooping cough that sounds like a TB-riddled goose trying to give a TED Talk underwater. And that’s just three afflictions from one single station in the whole cursed A-to-Z trainwreck that is my body. Wait till they get to S for scrotal sadness. Or W for wank-induced wrist pain. Or Z for the fucking zero I feel like most mornings before I even piss.
