A bodily, bile-laced tour through invention, disillusionment, and the stink of cultural delusion."

There’s a dry yellow pustule right at the inner crease of my thigh—not quite groin, not quite leg, exactly where your sweaty fold meets the ass-tang airlock—and I discovered it while scratching at my balls during a particularly stupid YouTube video on "Why India Was Once the Most Advanced Civilization." Yes, I know, my algorithm is a sadist with a sense of irony.

Anyway, the boil’s probably a clogged hair shaft or karmic punishment for being born with a cerebral cortex and a penis in this country, where we invented zero and then promptly started subtracting IQ points with every successive century, until now we’ve got engineering graduates who need to Google “how to boil an egg” and politicians who think cow piss is a fucking broadband solution.

But let’s rewind. Let's actually fucking rewind to that allegedly golden shit-soaked moment in Indian history when some sun-baked half-naked proto-Bengali genius (likely squatting somewhere near Patna with a turmeric-stained dhoti and a raging case of amoebiasis) looked at a blank space and said, “Yes. That’s something. That *is* something.”  

That, my friend, was zero. Śūnya. Cipher. The glorious round fuck-all that allowed human beings to finally count beyond their own fingers without needing a goat as an abacus.  

And not just zero—the motherfucking DECIMAL system. Base ten. Which, unlike our GDP charts, has structure. Has place value. Has order. This was not some bedtime fable bullshit—this was math that revolutionized trade, astronomy, engineering, fucking calculus down the line. Our sweltering subcontinent gave it to the Arabs, who gave it to Europe, who gave us colonization, fake democracy, and air fryers. You're welcome.

So what happened, huh? What the *fuck* happened after that?

Somewhere between Aryabhata scratching digits into a palm leaf and my neighbor using coconut oil to fix his inverter, we stopped inventing things and started believing in things. Blindly. Religiously. Aggressively. Like the kind of people who see Jesus in a chapati or think QR codes are Satan’s semen. We went from inventing a numerical abstraction that underpins modern computation—to arguing about whether ancient Hindus had WiFi and plastic surgery based on some poorly proofread Sanskrit verses that mostly describe how to fuck your cousin’s wife with tantric detachment.

You want to know the real invention we made after zero?

Fucking WhatsApp groups. Where your uncle with the receding scalp and rising nationalism sends JPEGs of Hanuman photoshopped onto the moon, claiming the NASA rover found proof of ancient Hindu civilization by spotting a trident pattern on a fucking rock. Meanwhile the same cunt can’t format a resume in Word without calling his niece.

And don’t get me started on the lead-based sindoor industry or the national obsession with putting saffron in things that shouldn’t be saffroned—like milk, rice, or fucking constitutional amendments.

But this is bigger than just lazy post-colonial bellyaching.

You know what's worse than being colonized? It's being *smug* and *stagnant* after it. Like a bloated constipated nation that shits out fake pride instead of actual progress.

We act like zero was our winning lottery ticket, and we’ve been coasting ever since. But you ever notice how everything else we do with numbers now is bullshit? GDP numbers are massaged harder than a Lok Sabha candidate's ego. Pollution indexes are manipulated until a lungful of carcinogens reads “moderate.” Exam results, voter data, birth rates—they’re all decimal-rich, zero-heavy, beautifully aligned—*utterly fucking meaningless*.

I read somewhere that Panini created one of the most sophisticated grammars ever conceived, millennia ago. Now every time I go to the grocery store, some shirtless goblin behind the counter speaks a dialect of Hindi that sounds like it was chewed up by a dyslexic goat and shat out through an Instagram reel.

What the fuck is the point of inventing zero if the only thing we do with it now is multiply it by our aspirations?

There are two kinds of countries in the world. The ones that use zero to build rockets. And the ones that use rockets to draw dicks on neighboring maps. Guess where we are.

Meanwhile, my boil itches again. The pus has congealed into a crust shaped almost like the Indian subcontinent. No joke. I laugh, cough, and nearly piss myself. Not from joy, but because my bladder, like this country, is too full of piss and too proud to admit it needs to empty.

See, science was never supposed to be spiritual. It was supposed to be skeptical, smelly, disobedient, curious. Like a teenager's armpit after a physics exam. But in India, we turn everything into a temple. A nuclear physicist dies, and some fucknut from TV declares he was probably the reincarnation of Vishwakarma. A techie gets a B visa, and ten thousand aunties light lamps to the gods of H-1B immigration.

We invented zero, but we outsourced *reason*. We sent that shit overseas. Elon Musk colonized space while we built temples for data plans. Even our science fairs are now like saffron-frosted birthday cakes—sweet-looking, hollow, and packed with carcinogens.

My rice cooker beeps. The steam smells like despair and too much hing. I take a leak in the corner bathroom where my own reflection looks like the bastard child of Bhaskara and a government clerk. I try to think of one thing we’ve invented in the last fifty years that’s actually *helped* the average person.

And don't say Aadhaar, you cocksucker. That shit's a surveillance wet dream with bad UI.  

Even zero had the humility to be nothing.  

But we—oh we—shove our ancient dicks into every global conversation like some tantric time-traveler who once dated Pythagoras and now won’t shut up about it at the reunion.

I scratch my thigh again. The boil’s leaking. It’s a satisfying kind of ooze. Warm. Slightly metallic. Definitely infected. I think of it as my personal decimal point. Right there. Separating fantasy from reality. History from hallucination.

Progress from pus.
