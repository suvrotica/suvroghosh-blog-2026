There is a specific, breathy cadence adopted by the purveyors of "mindfulness"—usually women named after weather phenomena or men who wear linen pants that cost more than my monthly electricity bill. They urge you to sit in a lotus position, close your eyes, and observe your thoughts like "clouds passing in the sky."

I have tried this. I sat on my bed, clad only in my boxers—which offer the structural integrity of a damp tissue—and closed my eyes. I did not see clouds. I saw a cacophony. I saw a crowded intersection in Gariahat where the traffic lights are merely decorative suggestions and every driver is honking with the desperation of a man sinking into quicksand. My bipolar disorder does not produce "clouds." It produces a carnival of feral animals, a festival of incompetence orchestrated by a neurological roommate who refuses to take his medication and insists on playing heavy metal polka at three in the morning.

For me, "mindfulness" is not a passive act of sitting and breathing until one achieves nirvana; it is the forensic pathology of writing.

It is only when I am hunched over the keyboard, the blue light of the monitor illuminating my face, that I can actually grab these "clouds" by the throat. Writing is how I perform a citizen’s arrest on my own psyche. I grab a fleeting, manic impulse—a thought that screams I should liquidate my company and start a goat farm in the Sundarbans—and I pin it to the digital page. I label it. I stare at it until it stops vibrating with that terrifying, hypomanic energy and becomes merely a sentence. A dull, grammatical structure subject to the laws of punctuation, if not logic.

I turn the volume knobs down. I mute the screaming. I impose a syntax on the chaos.

Of course, the result of this janitorial effort is rarely pretty. If the "mindfulness" gurus are selling a polished glass palace of spiritual clarity, my writing is the effluence dredged up from the drainpipes. It roils. It muddies the water. It drags up visitors from the subconscious—old embarrassments, ancient grudges, the time I waved at a stranger who was actually waving at the person behind me—that I would prefer to leave in the compost heap of history.

This is why my posts are, statistically speaking, fictional data. They are unreadable, unpopular scribbles strewn across the internet's periphery. They are the digital equivalent of those unwashed souls huddled under the flyover, the ones the pedestrians in the glittering thoroughfares of LinkedIn and Instagram step over with a practiced blindness. The algorithms, those digital homeowners' associations, do not want to see my shanty town of honest scruples. They want "five ways to optimize your morning routine," not a granular description of a middle-aged man in South Calcutta wrestling with the viscosity of his own despair.

People ignore my writing for the same reason they ignore a beggar exhibiting a spectacular cough: it is too real, too close to the bone, and frankly, it smells a bit like emotional mildew.

And yet, I type. I sit here, a small man in a humid room, curating the filth, organizing the disaster, content in the knowledge that while I may not be "zen," I am, at the very least, grammatically correct.
