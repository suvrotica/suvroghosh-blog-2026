When people talk about mindful meditation, or mindfulness in general, I think of writing, because it is when I write that I can consciously focus on the subtle nuances that rivet the unconscious streams of thought spanning across the littered mindscape of my bipolar mind. It is in writing that the noticing can happen, that I can label them and quiet them, and in some cases turn the volume knobs all the way down to mute. Sometimes the writing does roil and muddy things and bring up more unpleasantness and more visitors to the conscious than I would like, but that’s why my posts are unreadable, unpopular—just scribbles strewn on the internet that are ignored in the way people ignore beggars and invalids. True feelings and honest scruples and emotions have no place in the main glittering thoroughfares or polished glass palaces; they, like me, live hidden and huddled in the shanty boondocks of the third-world periphery, where no one can be bothered to look, lest they be disgusted.

And it’s whatever irritates me inside that I can sort of sift through in words, or at least try to. Most of the time I fail, but at least that’s what I do, like now. I can’t focus. I can’t sketch. I’m irritated, I’m angry, I’m depressed—I’m all these things all at once. And although I can try to focus on my breathing, and it calms me down to a certain extent, the things in the iceberg of the subconscious are far too huge to be handled so easily. I am not trying to make light of mindfulness meditation; it has its place in the attenuation of the default mode network, but when the underlying pathology is severe, that alone may not alleviate the disease. It may reduce the symptoms temporarily, is what I am saying.

And I don’t like the cottage industry of lewd larceny, bogosity, and religiosity mixed in with meditation. You really don’t need to listen to the halitosis of an Indian guru or a Tibetan bald thinks-he-knows-it-all these days. The whole exercise is pretty simple: just focus on your breath, and when your mind wanders, bring it back to your breath again. And because breathing is an autonomic process and internal to the brain, the switching is natural. It is also one of the most boring things to focus on, so your mind will want to wander, which is why, once you get a little practice in this, you can even catch yourself focusing on listening in on bizarrely boring business meetings that would previously have sent you off snoring. I, of course, don’t have to bother with human interaction much. I try to stay away from homo sapiens; they trigger my bipolarity. My place is with Calcutta cats, dogs, wall geckos, roaches, and spiders—that’s my safety net. I only look at people from a distance now, or through a smartphone. Hideously dangerous apes, I tell you.
