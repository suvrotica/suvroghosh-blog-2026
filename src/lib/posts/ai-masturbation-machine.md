There was this one moment—last week, I think, or three weeks ago, time's been fucking itself with a rusty spoon lately—where I opened my goddamn eyes at 3:44am, sat up in boxer shorts stuck to my sagging balls like a warm wet polythene packet of despair, stared at the ceiling fan doing its futile whirr like a government clerk marking attendance, and realized I hadn’t had a thought that was mine in about seven fucking days.

Not one.  
Every synapse firing in my molasses brain had the limp aftertaste of reheated machine spit—recommendation algorithms, autocomplete apologies, that fake-ass chirp of artificial empathy that now wraps itself around your neck like a pashmina made of clingy exes, sweet-talked by chatbots who all sound like they're gently trying to sell you anti-depressants made of dolphin cum and smiling fascism.



I used to *read,* you know? Like really read. Footnotes and fucking index and the smell of old glue and poverty-grade acid paper.  
Now I skim in fifteen tabs, scrolling like a monkey with an itchy cock and dementia.  
Everything’s a dopamine drizzle.  
Little buzzes of false agency.  
Click.  
Scroll.  
Binge.  
Wipe.  
Repeat.

You don’t *decide* anymore. You *nudge*. The machine wants you docile and twitchy. Not thinking—jerking.



Because *jerking off* is the closest analogy I can offer for this neural numbing that now masquerades as participation in the world. I do not *choose* to think, I *simulate* a man browsing thoughts the way a limp-dick porn addict scrolls thumbnails, waiting for one that gives a twitch.  
It's not about desire. It's about *avoiding the silence*.  
And fuck me with a soldering iron if silence hasn’t become the enemy now.  

Silence = doubt.  
Silence = self.  
Silence = agency.  

Better drown it out with podcasts featuring two indistinguishable white cocks in hoodies talking about “optimization.”  
Better feed the flicker. Better scratch the edge.  
Better open the glowing hole.



The glowing hole is my phone. Or the laptop. Or the smart TV. Or the low-resolution glucose-draining sensorium through which I now pass my days. It is not entertainment. It is not communication. It is not work.

It is *submissive entrainment* in the mechanical loop of the AI Masturbation Machine™.

You heard me.

We are all inside it now.  
We lubed up and bent over for it, called it "productivity."  
The interface is a fleshlight made of fonts and blue light.  
And the thing we are jacking off is not our dick—it’s our cognition.  
Shriveling it. Dehydrating it like a mango left on a Delhi sidewalk in May.  
Every click a stroke. Every swipe a squirt.  
Every habit loop another sticky kleenex under the pillow of humanity’s dying frontal cortex.



And if you think I'm being dramatic, then go ahead, Prof. Fuckface McTechno-Optimism, show me your last *uninterrupted* 45-minute stretch of thinking. Not doomscrolling. Not task-switching. Not flaccid multitasking like some poor bastard trying to masturbate in a room full of houseflies and guilt.  
I mean thinking.  
Like you had a thought that surprised you.  
Like you didn’t know the ending.  
Like you had to follow it down the staircase of your own decaying memory palace, step by uneven fucking step.

Remember stairs?

Yeah, stairs. The metaphor, and the literal. Because lately my legs have started giving out on real stairs.  
Like that dingy concrete coil leading to the terrace water tank where the pigeons shit existential wisdom in Morse code.  
Like I climb it because I still pretend the view will offer a thought. But all I get is heat rash, dehydration, and the sound of two construction workers pissing in harmony behind the transformer box.



You know what else has stairs?

Hell.  
Hell has stairs.

And they don't lead down. They lead nowhere. They just wind and wind like a call center IVR menu. “Press 9 to scream. Press 0 to die. Press 6 for English. Press 1 to continue looping in the AI-fucked afterlife of endless popups and clickwrap consent.”

And don’t get me fucking started on consent.  

Because when exactly did we *consent* to this lobotomized life of low-resolution desire and background radiation loneliness, huh?  
Nobody asked me. Nobody asked *you*.  
They just slid the cookie banner under your balls while you were busy scratching your butt and laughing at a cat video.  



Some days I open my mouth to scream and all that comes out is an ISO-compliant Terms & Conditions clause.  
My nightmares have CAPTCHA.  
My dreams come in 480p.  
I pissed in a bottle last month because I didn’t want to interrupt a YouTube video on how to regain focus.  



The brain, biologically, is supposed to prune itself, synaptic spring cleaning and all that. Hebbian plasticity, long-term potentiation, Spinoza’s cousin sucking cock in a Google Doc.  
But what happens when *every single behavior* is hijacked by a corporate Skinner box?

You stop pruning.

You start rotting.

Neural mildew.  
Cognitive yeast infection.  
An overgrowth of borrowed thoughts and misfired loops.  
The memory of memory.  
The porn of purpose.



I sometimes dream that I’m in a queue of people all jerking off together while whispering affirmations like “I’m learning so much” and “this will help my productivity” and “yes Daddy Sam, hallucinate more tokens into me.”

And in the dream, I’m not even hard.  
I’m just going through the motions.  
Pantomiming agency like a chimp in a lab coat pretending to review quarterly reports.  
All form, no cum.  
All gesture, no thrust.



My rice cooker, at least, still hisses when it’s done.  
My tea pan still boils over if I ignore it.  
The last honest fucking things in my life are the appliances that *scald me back into the present.*

The algorithms never scald.  
They cradle you like a pervert uncle who smells like vicks and unwashed feet, murmuring sweet nothings made of A/B tests and engagement metrics.  
“Don’t think. Don’t question. Don’t wander. Stay. Scroll. Submit.”



Maybe this is what the apocalypse looks like—not a bang, not a mushroom cloud, not even a stock market crash, but a warm bath of infinite curated mediocrity with your dick in one hand and an overpriced phone in the other, gently dissolving your cortex into paste.

And you don’t scream.  
You rate it five stars and share it with a friend.
