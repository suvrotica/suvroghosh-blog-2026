There was this moment—last week, perhaps, or possibly three weeks ago; time has recently taken on the consistency of lukewarm oatmeal—where I opened my eyes at 3:44 AM. I sat up, my pajamas clinging to me like a damp, desperate hug from a plastic grocery bag, stared at the ceiling fan performing its dutiful, dizzying rotation like a bored DMV clerk stamping forms, and realized I hadn’t had an original thought in approximately seven days.

Not one. 
Every synapse firing in my sluggish brain carried the faint, metallic aftertaste of processed data—recommendation algorithms, autocomplete pleasantries, and that synthetic chirp of artificial empathy. It’s a polite, digital kindness that wraps around your neck like a scarf made of cling-wrap, whispered by chatbots that all sound like they’re trying to sell you herbal tea infused with sunshine and smiling compliance.

I used to *read*, you know? Truly read. I engaged with footnotes, indexes, and the scent of old glue and cheap, acidic paper. Now, I skim across fifteen tabs, scrolling with the frantic energy of a squirrel who’s forgotten where he hid his nuts and is starting to suspect they never existed at all. Everything is a drizzle of cheap rewards. 
Little buzzes of false importance. 
Click. 
Scroll. 
Consume. 
Repeat.

You don’t *decide* anymore. You are *nudged*. The machine prefers you to be docile yet twitchy. Not thinking—just reacting.

Because "reacting" is the closest analogy I can offer for this mental fog that now masquerades as participating in the world. I do not *choose* to think; I *simulate* a person browsing thoughts the way a weary shopper wanders a fluorescent-lit aisle at 2:00 AM, waiting for a cereal box to jump out and claim their soul. It’s not about interest. It’s about *avoiding the silence*. And goodness knows, silence has become the enemy.

Silence = doubt. 
Silence = self. 
Silence = agency. 

Better to drown it out with a podcast featuring two indistinguishable men in expensive hoodies discussing “optimization.” Better to feed the flicker. Better to scratch the itch. Better to stare into the glowing rectangle.

The glowing rectangle is my phone. Or the laptop. Or the smart TV. It is the low-resolution, energy-draining filter through which I now pass my days. It isn’t entertainment. It isn’t work. It is a submissive loop within the Great Habituation Machine™.

We are all inside it now. 
We walked right in and called it "productivity." The interface is a trap made of elegant fonts and blue light. And the thing we are wearing down isn't our stamina—it’s our cognition. We’re dehydrating our brains like a piece of fruit left on a Delhi sidewalk in the peak of May. Every click is a reflex. Every swipe is a twitch. Every habit loop is another crumpled napkin under the pillow of our dying attention spans.

And if you think I’m being dramatic, then please, by all means, show me your last *uninterrupted* 45-minute stretch of pure thinking. Not doomscrolling. Not task-switching. Not that pathetic multitasking where you try to solve a problem while a fly bounces off your forehead. I mean *thinking*. 
Like you had a thought that actually surprised you. 
Like you didn’t know how the sentence would end. 
Like you had to follow an idea down the staircase of your own memory, step by uneven, dusty step.

Remember stairs?

Yes, stairs. Both the metaphor and the literal ones. Lately, my legs have started to complain on real stairs. Like that narrow concrete coil leading to the roof, where the pigeons stare at you with the unsettling wisdom of creatures who have seen too much. I climb them because I still pretend the view will provide a breakthrough. But all I get is a heat rash, a dry throat, and the distant sound of construction workers arguing about a transformer box.

You know what else has stairs? 
The afterlife. Or at least, the tedious version of it.

And those stairs don’t lead anywhere. They just wind around like a customer service phone menu. “Press 9 to sigh. Press 0 to disappear. Press 6 for a language you don’t speak. Press 1 to continue looping in this digital purgatory of endless pop-ups and 'I Agree' buttons.”

And don’t even get me started on consent.

When exactly did we *consent* to this hollowed-out life of low-resolution desires and background-noise loneliness? Nobody asked me. Nobody asked *you*. They just slid the terms and conditions under the door while we were busy laughing at a video of a cat falling off a toaster.

Some days I open my mouth to speak and all that comes out is a standardized privacy policy. My nightmares have those "I am not a robot" puzzles. My dreams are grainy. I stayed in my chair for three hours last night because I didn't want to pause a video about how to reclaim my time.

The brain is supposed to prune itself—synaptic spring cleaning. But what happens when every single behavior is hijacked by a corporate-sponsored feedback loop?

You stop pruning. You start... fermenting. 
An overgrowth of borrowed thoughts and misfired connections. The memory of a memory. The hollow image of a purpose.

I sometimes dream I’m in a long line of people all nodding in unison, whispering affirmations like “I’m being so efficient” and “This is great for my personal brand.” And in the dream, I’m not even interested. I’m just going through the motions. I’m pantomiming life like a trained animal in a lab coat pretending to file taxes. All gesture, no substance.

My rice cooker, at least, still hisses when it’s done. My tea pan still boils over if I ignore it. The last honest things in my life are the appliances that have the decency to *burn me back into the present.*

The algorithms never burn. They cradle you like a well-meaning but slightly creepy relative who smells of mothballs and menthol, murmuring sweet nothings made of data points. “Don’t think. Don’t question. Don’t wander. Stay. Scroll. Submit.”

Maybe this is what the end looks like—not a bang, not a cloud, but a warm bath of infinite, curated mediocrity, with your phone in one hand and your common sense in the trash, gently dissolving your mind into a fine paste.

And you don’t scream. You rate the experience five stars and share it with a friend. 

Perhaps it’s because I didn't inherit this glowing distraction machine like a trust-fund baby inherits a collection of questionable stocks. Maybe it’s because I was thrown into this digital bucket without a manual. Being where I am—tired, a bit broke, and surrounded by heat—I’m still clinging to the latest tech like a hungry stray dog with a discarded smartphone.

Everything we’re addicted to here—the fast food, the fast fashion, the endless platforms—was made somewhere else, perfected in the boredom of colder climates. They *earned* their complications through centuries of industry; we just imported the symptoms.

We skipped the slow progress and went straight to the heavy sedation of modernity—AI that thinks for us, cars we can't repair, and phones that occupy our brains while we still live among the ruins. We live with the final products of someone else’s journey, and like children licking the wrappers of a meal we didn't eat, we’ve confused *having the app* with *having a life*.
