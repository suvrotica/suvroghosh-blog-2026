It starts with the stink of kerosene.  

Not the nostalgic Rabindrasangeet-scented kind, mind you, not the oil-lamp-on-balcony version that your ma would light during Kalboishakhi storms and mutter about load-shedding while slapping mosquitoes off her sweaty armpits with a wet towel, but the violent, raw, paint-thinner-to-the-brain kind of kerosene that leaks from a dented hurricane lantern balanced on a bamboo pole like some sort of flaming fuck-you to enlightenment, the kind of flame that doesn’t warm your soul or light your path but roasts your balls and fills your lungs with lung cancer because the wick was trimmed by someone whose primary education came from a busted toilet block that once served as the library annex of a school that was proud to claim Tagore’s gardener once pissed near its compound wall.  

That’s what remains of Bengali illumination.  

And not even metaphorically.  

No, literally. Go to the village outskirts or the slum stretches behind any metro expansion—where some "cultured" fuck once held a harmonium soirée and now the only music is the sound of untreated sewage backfiring into a child’s mouth—and you will find a hurricane lamp swinging on a rusty nail like the ghost of Vidyasagar’s last hemorrhoid.  

Because we don't inherit the city.  
We molest it.  
We don’t preserve the past.  
We chew it up and fart it into WhatsApp forwards.  

Somewhere between fucking the British (who, to be fair, gave us the railways and a decent postal system before they stole our fucking marbles, gold, and intellectual independence) and then fucking our own meritocracy into the ground, we learned this neat trick of masturbating to the idea of the Bengali Renaissance while letting the actual living tissue of thought, debate, science, and curiosity shrivel up like a dead foreskin in the Howrah Station urinal.  

Once, we built observatories. Now, we build coaching centers in basements that flood during monsoon and still have the gall to call them “IIT Foundation Gurukul 2.0.”  
Once, we wrote treatises. Now, we write captions under Instagram reels of men pouting like constipated hyenas under lighting worse than a crematorium's back door.

We were supposed to be thinkers. Rationalists. Critical fuckers with backbones made of Chandannagar steel and enough moral mass to reject stupid shit like astrology and caste and which fucking god wears which color of sari on which weekday.

Now?  

Now we wear rings on every finger for "energy balance" while discussing the Bhagavad Gita inside a Domino's Pizza.  
While our kids memorize MCQs to enter NIT Asansol, knowing full well they’ll end up in some Gurgaon shithole debugging code written by a coked-up manager with an MBA from IIM-Kozhikode who thinks “Kafka” is a new SaaS product for invoice reconciliation.

There was a time education meant battling darkness.

Now? Education *is* darkness.  
Rote vomit.  
Half-dead syllabi.  
Textbooks full of errors.  
Classrooms where you can smell the despair clinging to the plaster like fungus on an old man's nutsack.  
And don't even start on the private tuitions. Each one a little ecosystem of dead ambition, where some woman with breath like expired rice explains Newton's Laws while planning her next WhatsApp MLM hustle.

But it’s not just the education.

It’s the pride. The smug, cum-streaked pride in our own cultural ejaculate.  
Every fucker who once heard “Ei poth jodi na shesh hoy” in a taxi thinks he understands cinema.  
Every second male dickweed in Park Circus believes he *is* Ritwik Ghatak reborn, if only his father hadn’t forced him into B.Com (Hons.) and early marriage to a cousin with nice calves.  
And the rest?  
They read the first 20 pages of "Pather Panchali" in Class VI, jerked off to the memory, and now quote it in LinkedIn posts on leadership.  

We parade our literature like a corpse in sunglasses, propped up and wheeled through lit fests where bored housewives buy overpriced Bengali editions of Gabriel García Márquez they will never read while sipping gin and nodding along to panel discussions where some bald fuck says "Postcoloniality in the Post-Rabindric Age" and everyone claps because no one wants to admit that not a single one of them could tell a Kovalevskaya curve from their own anal hair.

And the city?

The city is a suppurating wound.

The pavements are diarrheic.  
The air is loaded with metal and apology.  
The river is a necrophiliac soup of Lord-knows-what-pesticides and hope, and the fish that come out of it twitch in Bengali oil like they’re trying to dance their way back to 1890.  

We have gone from *man of letters* to *man who sells fake degree letters from a Baguiati photocopy center that also does passport photos and wedding invites.*  
From *jatra and jibon* to *reels and red dots on married WhatsApp aunties’ photos.*  
From *Bose built a lab* to *Basu built a pujo pandal out of plastic test tubes and got 3.4 lakh likes.*

And when the power cuts out—and it will, because it always fucking does—you’ll still see the hurricane lamp.  
Somewhere.

Not as symbol.  
As actual fucking necessity.

Because the grid is shot.  
The city’s nervous system is as stable as a diabetic drunk on a trampoline.  
And all we have is the soft hiss of that burning kerosene, one step away from setting the entire sari-draped, paunch-scratching, impotent cultural corpse ablaze.

But we won’t burn it.  
No, we’ll keep lighting that lamp like assholes lighting scented candles in a morgue.

Because we like the smell.

It reminds us of when we still had oil in the lamp.  
Before we shoved it up our own ass.  

Where it now burns quietly.  
Next to the last living brain cell in Calcutta.
