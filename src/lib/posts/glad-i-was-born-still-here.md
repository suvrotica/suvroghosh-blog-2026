The cup is chipped at the rim—an old, thick, black thing that once pretended to be elegant, back when my family still believed in “sets” (tea set, dinner set, moral set), when my mother would align crockery like soldiers and my father would align principles like bank ledgers, and now the cup lives in exile with me on this unfashionable southern edge of the city where the air smells of damp concrete, cheap phenyl, and the kind of ambitious garbage that arrives in plastic and never really leaves. This was in two cup set that my sister had gifted me many years ago, and this one survived death like me. 

I run my thumb over the chip every morning, not because I’m sentimental, but because the body likes data: the brain takes one small roughness and says, here, a fact you can trust. The cup will cut you if you drink carelessly. The kettle will whistle when it’s ready. The newspaper will lie in predictable ways. These are solid. These are physics. These are not people.

People are more spooky, disembodied head in statistical shirts. People are *statistical generalizations* pretending to be stories.

The blanket is the kind of optimistic lie you buy in this city—cotton, light, printed with little geometric shapes that look like they were designed by a committee that has never once met a January morning—so when I pull it up to my chin, it doesn’t so much *warm* me as politely agree that warmth is a nice concept, and the cold comes anyway, sliding in from the tiles, from the damp wall that pretends it’s neutral but is secretly a radiator for misery, from the metal window latch that feels like it spent the night in a freezer, and I lie there with my knees tucked like a guilty child, listening to my own breathing become audible (winter does that; it makes the body confess).

Calcutta cold is not Canada cold—no heroic icicles, no Instagram-worthy fog, no snow that allows you to pretend the universe is clean—just this thin *thanda* that doesn’t kill you, which is precisely why it’s so irritating, because it’s a persistent bureaucrat of discomfort, stamping your bones with small delays, making you slow down, making everything take longer: getting up, finding socks, deciding whether you have the moral stamina to wash your face with water that feels like it’s been stored in a judge’s glare.

I’m fifty-something, which is an age where the body begins to act like a mildly disgruntled tenant who has discovered consumer rights. It complains. It files petitions. It objects to stairs. It asks why you are still doing this whole “existence” thing without providing adequate heating. And under this blanket, on this particular morning, my mind does what it always does when the world gets quiet enough: it starts auditing my life, like a petty accountant with a lantern, counting debits and credits that were never meant to be counted.

I have received a little love and a lot of hate, yes—hate that arrived dressed as advice, hate that came disguised as concern, hate that wore the uniform of “realism,” and also the plain, honest hate that needs no costume at all—and if I’m being scientific about it (which is my habitual sin), I can even plot it as a distribution: a few sharp peaks of kindness, a long fat tail of contempt, with the mean somewhere south of tolerable. The trouble with plotting your life is that you start trusting the graph more than the mess, and the mess is where the actual animal lives.

And yet—this is the embarrassing part I keep trying to edit out of myself—I’m glad I was born. Not in the “the universe has a plan” manner (the universe can barely manage hydrogen), not in the nationalistic manner (the nation is an invention with paperwork), not even in the family-altar manner (I have never been able to worship anything without wanting to inspect its wiring). Just glad, in the blunt way you might be glad that a train didn’t hit you, or that a fever broke, or that you opened your eyes and the room was still there, unredeemed but real.

Life is a ridiculous miracle. Not a spiritual miracle—no benevolent manager upstairs, no cosmic customer care number—but a biochemical miracle, which is stranger, because it has no intention behind it, only consequences. A billion small reactions in a bag of saltwater, membranes keeping chaos politely outside, enzymes doing their tiny factory shifts, mitochondria (those ancient squatters from some prehistoric merger) churning out ATP like a dhobi churning clothes, and all of it happening in near-darkness, inside flesh that is simultaneously clever and stupid, fragile and stubborn.

The thing about being science-brained is that you cannot fully enjoy this miracle without immediately ruining it with explanations, and then ruining the explanations with doubts. Thermodynamics says the universe prefers disorder, entropy creeping upward like an unscrupulous landlord raising rent, and yet here I am—this improbable local pocket of order—trying to maintain a stable body temperature under a blanket that could be outperformed by a decent newspaper. How? By burning ordered fuel into disordered heat, by dumping entropy into the room, by stealing structure from the world and paying it back as noise. The body is a small political economy: constant extraction, constant waste, a metabolism that is basically neoliberalism with better branding.

When I was younger, I used to think my unhappiness was philosophical, almost elegant—*existential*, *alienated*, *post-leftist*, the sort of suffering you might hang on a wall in a French museum with a grant attached. That is performative intellectualism, and I despise it even as I catch myself doing it, like a man lecturing on humility with a microphone. Some of my unhappiness was just physics: poor sleep, bad light, bad food, too much caffeine, too little movement, a nervous system marinated in threat. The mind is not a disembodied judge. It is an organ, and organs are moody.

The hate, though—let’s not reduce everything to serotonin and tiles—the hate had its own sociology. There’s the hate you get for not being pliable, for not smiling at nonsense, for refusing to pretend that myth is history and history is destiny. There’s the hate you get for being too bookish in a country that uses books mainly as wedding decor. There’s the hate you get for asking “how do you know?” in a room that prefers “who told you?” There’s the hate that comes from the patriarchy when you do not kneel properly to fathers, bosses, gurus, leaders, and other varieties of male furniture.

Nationalism, in particular, is a reliable hate-machine because it gives people a cheap way to feel tall. You take a random accident of birth—soil, language, passport—and inflate it into a cosmic identity, and suddenly your mediocrity feels like destiny. It’s alchemy for insecure men. And the mythology—the gods, the epics, the divine ancestry—works as the fragrance sprayed over the whole project, so you don’t notice the rot. The stories are beautiful, yes; so is opium. Beauty is not truth. *I keep having to say this to myself*, because my own brain loves stories the way a child loves sugar, and if I’m not careful I start mistaking narrative satisfaction for reality.

Reality, when you look at it without incense, is mostly administrative. British colonialism, for example, wasn’t a mythic clash of civilizations—it was bureaucracy with guns, ledgers with hunger, shipping manifests with cholera, a corporation with a flag. We inherited the paperwork and kept the hunger. The city itself—this Calcutta I’m supposedly from, as if a city is a womb and not a machine—was assembled out of mercantile convenience and imperial paranoia, then left to ferment in its own fumes.

There’s a folk etymology that likes to wander around smugly, as folk etymologies do, claiming “posh” comes from “Port Out, Starboard Home,” some colonial-era shipping preference for cooler cabins; it’s nonsense, of course, a story invented because the mind prefers cute acronyms to boring linguistic drift. We do that constantly—build a little myth because the truth is unphotogenic. We do it with words, we do it with nations, we do it with our own biographies. I have done it with my unhappiness: made it into a narrative of exile and injustice, when sometimes it was simply me being difficult, or unlucky, or both.

Still. I return to the thin blanket, to the body in its small bed, because this is where philosophy meets plumbing. Underfunded life has its own acoustics: the refrigerator hum you cannot replace, the neighbor’s water pump starting like a tired animal, the occasional honk that sounds like someone arguing with geometry, the distant cough that isn’t dramatic enough to be tragic but is persistent enough to be political. I have been pushed to the unfashionable fringes of South Calcutta—where the city thins out into a mix of new concrete and old habits, where the roads feel like they were planned by people who hate pedestrians—and exile is not a single event but a daily texture, a mild abrasion, like cheap fabric against skin.

I remember old North Calcutta—yes, I can feel the nostalgia violin section warming up, ready to pour sepia syrup over everything, so let me swat it away: it was not some golden era of virtue. It was crowded, loud, unjust, and frequently ridiculous. But it had density, intellectual and physical, the kind that makes you feel less alone even when you hate everyone. In a small lane you could hear ten lives at once: a radio, a quarrel, a joke, a sermon, a child’s recitation, a shopkeeper’s arithmetic. Now the city is spread, atomized, each household sealed in its own little anxious capsule, and the public realm has been outsourced to WhatsApp fury and billboard patriotism.

Under this blanket, I think about love—because it would be dishonest not to—and it embarrasses me the way tenderness always does, arriving in the voice of the one emotion that cannot defend itself with sarcasm. The love I received was rarely grand. It was practical. Someone saving me a seat. Someone sharing a book. Someone writing back. Someone remembering a detail I thought had vanished. The love was often quiet, which is why I didn’t notice it at the time; hate announces itself like a marching band, love tends to show up like a small light left on in a corridor.

And the hate—well, hate is easier, hate is lazy, hate is a discount emotion that people buy in bulk. Hate requires no maintenance. You can hate someone without knowing them. You can hate someone as a hobby. Hate scales beautifully. Love, inconveniently, is local. Love asks you to pay attention. Love forces you to encounter another mind as real. This is why patriarchy and nationalism prefer hate: it’s cheap fuel for controlling crowds. A crowd in love is a logistical nightmare.

I’m supposed to be rational—atheist, post-leftist, suspicious of spiritual kitsch—and I am, mostly, but rationality is not a blanket either, not one that keeps you warm by itself. Rationality is a tool, like a good knife: it can cut bread, it can cut lies, it can cut you if you get careless. I have used it to slice through religious nonsense, and then used it to slice through my own hopes, and there were times when I mistook self-sabotage for rigor. Skepticism, taken too far, becomes another kind of superstition: the belief that nothing can be good unless it has been proven in court.

So I try a different posture, not hope—hope is too grand, too polished, too likely to be sold to me by someone with a flag or a god or a startup deck—but a smaller thing: acknowledgment. The fact that I am here, under an inadequate blanket, in a body that continues to run its chemical miracles without asking my permission. The fact that the heart keeps beating even when the mind is sulking. The fact that the lungs keep negotiating with the air, which in this city is often a compromise at best.

There’s a word, *adda*, which outsiders like to romanticize as if it’s a UNESCO heritage site—“Bengali intellectual culture,” they say, as though we were all sitting in coffee houses discussing Tagore and revolution, when half the time it was men rehearsing their own cleverness while women did the work. Still, the impulse behind *adda*—to talk, to argue, to think aloud—is not trivial. Thinking aloud is how a mind tests itself against another mind. It’s how you find out where you’re lying. And perhaps that’s what I am doing now, in the private *adda* between my body and my thoughts, under this thin blanket: trying to catch my own exaggerations, my own melodrama, my own tendency to turn pain into identity.

Because unhappiness can become a profession. You can get good at it. You can develop a style. You can curate your disappointments like stamps. I have done this. I have been proud of my misery at times, as though it proved my intelligence, as though joy were for idiots and the uneducated. That is adolescent vanity wearing a middle-aged face.

What I can say, without poetry or prayer, is simple: I am glad I am alive. Even if barely. Especially if barely, because “barely” means the margin exists, the system still converges, the equation still has a solution within tolerances. There is something indecently stubborn about life, and I share that indecency, whether I like it or not.

Outside, the light is doing that winter thing—pale, almost reluctant, as if the sun is a junior clerk punching in late—and the blanket shifts when I move, making a soft crackle like paper, and for a moment I feel the ridiculous intimacy of it: this small friction, this warmth that is not warmth, this body insisting on its little chemical rebellion against entropy, and I tug the blanket up again, as if the universe can be negotiated with by minor adjustments.
