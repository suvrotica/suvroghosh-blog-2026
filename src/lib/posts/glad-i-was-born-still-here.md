The cup is chipped at the rim—an old, thick, black thing that once pretended to be elegant, back when my family still believed in “sets” (tea set, dinner set, moral set), when my mother would align crockery like soldiers and my father would align principles like bank ledgers, and now the cup lives in exile with me on this unfashionable southern edge of the city where the air smells of damp concrete, cheap phenyl, and the kind of ambitious garbage that arrives in plastic and never really leaves. This was in two cup set that my sister had gifted me many years ago, and this one survived death like me. 

I run my thumb over the chip every morning, not because I’m sentimental, but because the body likes data: the brain takes one small roughness and says, here, a fact you can trust. The cup will cut you if you drink carelessly. The kettle will whistle when it’s ready. The newspaper will lie in predictable ways. These are solid. These are physics. These are not people.

People are more spooky, disembodied head in statistical shirts. People are *statistical generalizations* pretending to be stories.

I’ve received a little bit of love and a whole lot of hate in my unhappy life, and if you think I’m about to deliver a heroic monologue about “rising above,” please relax—this isn’t that kind of neighborhood and I’m not that kind of person. I am, by temperament and training, a man who prefers error bars to affirmations. But I’m glad I was born, and I’m glad I’m still alive, and this is the sort of admission that feels, to me, like showing up at a respectable *adda* wearing an undershirt: indecently intimate, faintly ridiculous, and still—annoyingly—true.

Hate is a loud substance. It has a cheap volatility. Love, when it arrives, often comes in small quantities, like antibiotics in a country full of counterfeit pharmacies: a tiny blister pack of the real thing, easily lost in the drawer, easily dismissed as placebo until you realize your fever broke anyway. Hate announces itself. Love tends to mutter and slip out early.

The brain, of course, is a petty chemist. Social rejection lights up the same circuitry as physical pain—*or something close enough that it’s not poetic exaggeration but a neurological nuisance*—and you can name the regions and the neurotransmitters and still not make it feel any less primitive. A harsh word in a comment box, typed by someone whose entire life may be a leaking ceiling and a borrowed phone, can still land in your chest like a small stone. The cortex can compose sonnets about resilience; the amygdala just flinches and keeps the receipt.

And then there is the ancient Bengali hobby of turning pain into performance. We are a people who can turn a mosquito bite into a civil war, who can write an epic about a missed bus, who can extract metaphysics from a power cut. The culture rewards elegant suffering. The *bhadralok* tradition—our beloved theater of refined complaint—teaches you to hate loudly but politely, to stab with grammar, to poison with footnotes. Even our affection sometimes arrives wrapped in correction: “You did well—*but why not better?*”

Somewhere in here I’m supposed to talk about my unhappy life, but notice how quickly that becomes a “story,” and stories are treacherous because they make the past look curated, as if I had a plan, as if misery came with a syllabus and a timetable. It didn’t. It was more like the Kolkata monsoon: one day you’re managing, next day you’re wading, and then some well-meaning auntie says, “At least the rain is good for the gardens,” as if your drowned shoes are merely a horticultural inconvenience.

The hate I’ve received has come in many costumes. Some of it wore ideology: the cheap nationalism that treats doubt as treason and ignorance as heritage. Some of it wore religion: that market-stall spirituality where every question is answered by a sticker—*Jai Shri Something*—and every human complexity is hammered into a single blunt slogan. Some of it wore class: the sneer that says, you are not successful therefore you are not real. And some of it was intimate, domestic, the kind that doesn’t shout but corrodes—an acid drip in the corner of a marriage, a friendship that becomes an audit.

I would like to pretend I’m above all this. But I’m not above it. I’m beside it, inside it, sometimes made of it. Rationalist, atheist, science-and-math brained—yes. But the brain is not a clean laboratory. It is a bazaar with competing vendors, and the vendor selling self-loathing offers discounts.

Here’s a folk etymology I used to believe as a child: that “Calcutta” comes from “Kali-katta,” the place where Kali was “cut” into the earth, as if the city itself was born from a divine surgical procedure. It’s nonsense, mostly, a myth stitched to a place-name like a patriotic badge. But the impulse is revealing: we want our suffering sanctified. We want the chaos to have a goddess-shaped reason. We want the city to be *destiny* rather than drainage.

The adult version of that is nationalism. Same hunger, newer packaging. You take a messy, contingent history—colonial extraction, partition trauma, bureaucratic rot, the long hangover of feudal habit—and you paint it gold and call it “civilization.” Then you demand applause. Then you demand silence. Then you demand that anyone who points at a crack in the wall must be the enemy, not the person holding a flashlight.

I dislike this, as you might imagine. I also dislike the academic version, where the same crack becomes a thesis topic and a conference panel and an identity performance, with the speaker solemnly announcing their “positionality” as if the universe issued them a laminated ID card. *I distrust solemnity in all its forms.* It’s usually hiding something. Sometimes it’s hiding a sales pitch.

So where does love fit into this grim little chemistry set?

It arrives the way actual medicines often arrive in India: not through institutions but through people. A friend who calls when there is nothing to gain. A stranger who reads something you wrote and says, quietly, that it landed. A partner who doesn’t try to fix you into a motivational poster but stands near you anyway, like a wall that doesn’t move when the wind gets theatrical. Even a child—some nephew, some neighbor’s kid—who asks a blunt, innocent question and briefly forces you to answer like a human being, not a wounded professor.

The quantity is small. The effect is not.

The hate, meanwhile, has a strange generosity. It teaches you the shape of other people’s hunger. It shows you the parts of society that cannot tolerate ambiguity. It teaches you that many adults are simply scared children with salaries. It also teaches you, unpleasantly, how easily you can become them. On certain days I can feel the hate inside me warming up like the kettle, looking for an excuse. I can feel the mind rehearsing its insults, polishing its contempt, preparing to feel superior because it cannot bear to feel powerless.

This is where I’m supposed to pivot into redemption, I know. The narrative machine wants it. The reader wants it. I want it. But watch me swerve away, deliberately, like a bus on Rashbehari Avenue avoiding a pothole the size of a small philosophical problem.

There is no redemption. There is only management.

I manage by making tea. By reading books that don’t flatter me. By looking at a simple equation and remembering that the universe, for all its cruelty, is at least *consistent* in its indifference. By remembering that my body is an animal and deserves basic maintenance. By treating joy not as a life philosophy but as a rare migratory bird: it appears, it perches, it leaves, and you don’t chase it with a net.

Sometimes I manage by remembering one Sanskrit line I learned long ago—not as prayer, but as artifact, like an old coin dug out of the mind: “अहिंसा परमो धर्मः.” Non-violence is the highest duty. I don’t believe in “duty” the way priests mean it, but I do believe in harm, and I do believe in the easy slide from inner bitterness to outer cruelty. On bad days, my atheism is not a triumph; it’s just a refusal to outsource responsibility. No god will forgive me for being nasty. No goddess will absolve me for enjoying it.

On the worst days I find myself making a crude, materialist bargain with existence. I tell myself: you have already endured this much. Statistically speaking, you might as well stick around to see what happens next. The city will keep mutating. The politics will keep metastasizing. The young will keep inventing new ways to be careless. There will be new jokes, new books, new kinds of stupidity. The universe has an endless budget for novelty.

And then, sometimes, very quietly, without ceremony—without violins, without hashtags, without the oily sheen of “inspiration”—I notice a small fact: I am here. I am breathing. The tea is hot. The chipped cup has not betrayed me. Outside, on the stained balcony railing, a crow has landed with the bored authority of a municipal officer, cocked its head, and looked at me as if I am just another piece of Kolkata clutter that refuses to be thrown away.

I lift the cup, careful of the chip, and drink anyway.
