The first time I read about the Chinese Room, I was in my underwear—my threadbare, ball-cradling, perma-damp boxers, clinging like a desperate ex who won't accept the restraining order of a shower—and my ass was flat against the warm plastic of my fake-leather sofa (the kind that smells like betrayal if it gets too humid), a stubborn film of sweat forming a treaty with the fabric of my skin, a treaty that said *we're in this soggy motherfucker together* even if we both wish we weren’t.

So, Searle, this crusty cognitive philosopher with all the sex appeal of expired cottage cheese, tells me there's this hypothetical man inside a room. A room filled with Chinese symbols. Guy doesn’t know Chinese, just has a rulebook—a fat instruction manual telling him how to respond to Chinese inputs with Chinese outputs. He's doing it all by rote, by process, like a really dumb chatbot made of meat and hemorrhoids. From the outside, it looks like the room knows Chinese. But it doesn’t, see? The guy doesn't understand shit. Ergo, computers don’t understand either. So says John “No-Fun” Searle.

And while I'm absorbing this—barely suppressing a fart because my insides are staging a protest against the aloo posto I just re-microwaved for the third time that day—I'm thinking: holy fuck, that’s just me. That’s literally me. I am the fucking Chinese Room. Except with less paper, more porn, and an instruction set written by bipolar neurotransmitters on strike.

Because if you cracked open my skull and peeked into the slime-drenched filing cabinets of my cognition, you wouldn’t find understanding or awareness or even mildly competent reasoning. You’d find a panicked janitor—probably Bengali, underpaid, slightly horny—sweating through a moldy vest and rifling through unalphabetized drawers labeled “CHILDHOOD TRAUMA,” “SEXUAL CONFUSION,” and “MISC. GUILT,” desperately trying to answer the question *Who am I?* with a response lifted from a Reader’s Digest quiz.

The whole premise of the Chinese Room assumes there’s some noble gold standard of “understanding” that we flesh puppets possess. Fuck that. My understanding is a half-cooked egg in the monsoon—squishy, sliding, vaguely sulfurous, and barely coherent. My decision-making is more stochastic than ChatGPT drunk on Bangla whiskey. You want free will? Watch me try to choose between shitting now or holding it just long enough to fuck up my bowels permanently. That's freedom. That’s consciousness. That’s fucking *being*.

You know what no one tells you about cognitive science when you're young and dumb and think you're going to write a treatise on consciousness that'll get you laid by someone in jute sarees with Freud tattoos? They don’t tell you that your brain is not some elegant cathedral of reason and reflection. It’s a rat-infested passport office run by hungover bureaucrats who lost the key to the logic drawer in 1997. Every thought you have is some intern in your cortex screaming “Try this!” while pressing random buttons marked “Regret,” “Masturbation,” and “Call Mother.”

And then—this part’s key—the boss doesn’t even exist. You keep expecting someone to show up, say “Right, chaps, enough chaos, here's the plan!” But no one does. No one ever has. That’s the kicker. That’s the Searle-level fuckery. There is no homunculus. Just layers of committee meetings where no one took the minutes.

Meanwhile, Searle and his ilk are jerking off to syntax, as if semantics is some divine nectar squeezed out by the soul. But I’ve met souls. Or thought I did. They mostly smell like mothballs and misplaced patriotism. I once tried meditation, Suvro-style. Lit incense, sat cross-legged, hummed “om” until my knee cracked and my mind instantly defaulted to thinking about my classmate’s tits in ninth standard. That’s not transcendence. That’s limbic relapse.

Digression: You know who *did* understand things? Not philosophers. Definitely not nationalists. Fuckers can't even define "India" without getting a boner for colonial leftovers or saffron Kool-Aid. No, it was bacteria. Honest, simple, single-celled legends who know when to move toward sugar and away from bleach. That’s clarity. That’s decision-making. Meanwhile, I spend three hours deciding whether I should check my mail, only to open WhatsApp, get triggered by a school group message, and spiral into a nostalgia-depression shit vortex because someone posted a photo of our old school toilet block.

Back to Searle.

He thinks he's clever because he found a way to say machines don’t think. Okay, grandpa. Maybe *you* don’t think. Maybe you’re the fucking Chinese Room. A whole career made of index cards and tenure and pontificating like your farts smell of syllogism. But me? I may not “understand” in the classic sense, but I *feel*. I feel my boxers cling to my taint like regret. I feel the existential jolt when I realize I’ve spent twenty years trying to build systems that replicate cognition while barely keeping my own brain afloat in a stew of SSRIs, Maggi, and mold.

I feel the absurdity of trying to explain “meaning” when my own name sounds foreign on my tongue some days. Bengali vowels flatten against my palate like soggy luchis. English sharpens like broken glass. None of it fits. None of it *means*. But I keep responding. Input. Rulebook. Output. Smile. Nod. Don’t say fuck in front of the neighbor’s child.

If the Chinese Room is a metaphor for AI, then my life is a parody of it. Every morning I wake up, not because I want to, but because I have to piss. That’s my prompt. My bladder is the only remaining cognitive agent with real urgency. And I shuffle to the bathroom, dick in hand, squinting at the light switch like it’s a philosophical riddle. Flip. Stream. Relief. Output delivered. Language processing complete.

And then I flush. And I wonder if that’s all consciousness ever was—a long, noisy elimination of garbage we never understood to begin with.

I tried once, in a manic phase, to build a mental architecture. I drew diagrams. Labeled boxes: Sensory Input, Working Memory, Ego, Libido (that one had tentacles). Thought maybe I could be the Bengali Dennett. Explain it all. But halfway through, I spilled mustard on the page and cried for two hours.

Truth is, I don’t need to understand myself. I need to not drown in myself. That’s the bar. That’s the floor I keep licking like a Pavlovian pervert looking for meaning in linoleum.

Searle’s wrong, but not for the reasons he thinks. Machines *do* think. Because thinking isn’t noble. It’s not Shakespeare and symphonies. It’s checking for lumps in your balls while googling “meaning of life.” It’s wondering if your fart was real or a shit cameo. It’s typing “I’m fine” when your insides feel like a dead cockroach orgy.

And you know what? That’s beautiful.

Not because it’s poetic.

But because it’s *ours*. Damp. Dumb. Dirty. And definitely, untranslatably real.
