The smell hit first, as it always does—like God herself squatted over Gariahat and took a stress-induced dump laced with cumin, congealed ambition, and half-digested government tenders.

See, in 2014, when I came back, this country was already a gutter. Not metaphorically. Literally. A living, burping, postcolonial rectum with open drainage and open data, where every street corner had a water pipe half-dug, a wire half-chewed, a dog half-dead, and a man half-fucking something he didn’t understand—usually a bureaucracy form or a patriotic fantasy.

But now—oh now—it’s a *proud* open manhole. And not just open, but gaping, stretching, moaning, like it *wants* you to fall in, wants your foot to twist sideways into the sewage of national confidence, your tibia clicking against rusted rods of bad planning, your shin deep in the diarrheal soup of Digital India, where every line of code written to “empower the citizen” has a 38% chance of being plagiarized from Stack Overflow and a 100% chance of being weaponized against you in Aadhaar court.

Because here’s the thing—doing isn’t the problem in India.

**Doing** is never the problem.

*Claiming* is.

Shaking hands. Shaking dicks. Shaking faith loose from the sockets of people already cross-eyed from holy hysteria and WhatsApp enlightenment. Announce it, put a ribbon on it, never finish it. Declare a flyover in 2003, slap an inauguration sticker in 2022, let it collapse under a mango cart by 2026. The PR is permanent. The pillar? Optional.

And people—oh, the people—are super holy now. So holy their piss evaporates into Vedic ozone and comes back as monsoon floods. So confident they shit standing up, bare-assed, on your dignity. So free they can face-fuck the country with the boldness of a baba mid-blessing, and no one says a thing because it’s rude to interrupt progress with facts.

Engineering here isn’t about load-bearing structures—it’s about load-bearing *fictions*. We don’t build bridges to carry traffic; we build bridges to carry speeches, and god forbid if you ask about foundation depths or soil tests—because then you’re a traitor, a pessimist, a middle-class bastard with a superiority complex who probably masturbates to train timetables.

We built a smart city on a swamp, my friend. And we’ll do it again. Because when the sewage backs up and floods the biometric servers, when the copper theft exposes the naked neck of our surveillance state, when the AI chatbot built for grievance redressal starts replying with "Jai Shri Ram" and your menstrual history—we’ll simply rename the project. Add “2.0” and a blue tick. Announce a new funding round. Hire the same four cocksuckers to design the next digital uterus scanner.

The confidence is unkillable. Bulletproof. Eternal. Like a rash that believes in itself.

Because *doing* is performance.

Completion is bourgeois.

What matters is to *be seen doing*. To talk, to tweet, to host a summit. That’s what shakes the nation. Shakes it like a bad orgasm under fluorescent lighting, like a cramp mid-copulation, like a holy man twitching through constipation on live TV while explaining the quantum chakra of a mudra-powered toilet flush.

And so here I am, sitting in my own cracked-tiled shanty, sipping from a rust-ringed steel cup of tea made on an induction stove powered by stolen inverter current, reading about another revolutionary app that lets poor people report potholes directly to a database no one checks, feeling the weight of this country’s confidence grind against my perineum like a priest at a school reunion.

Even my boxers are giving up. The elastic’s lost its will. One leg droops like a disappointed uncle. My left ball sticks to my thigh like it’s trying to migrate to Bangladesh. I haven’t come in years. I fart more than I fuck. My spine hurts in three languages.

And every day, I wake up to more declarations: satellite launches, digital dashboards, turmeric-backed COVID cures, IIT-verified dildos, and startup bros with cum in their beards talking about “disrupting” fish delivery via blockchain.

But the manhole remains open. Waiting.

Waiting for you.

And me.

To fall in.

And some days, when I squint at the sun rising over the rebar silhouettes of half-finished towers and feel the damp of my underballs glue me to my chair—I almost want to let it take me. Let the country swallow me into its stinking confidence. No protest. No dignity. Just a final, farting slide into relevance.

But I can’t.

Because I know, deep in the fossilized folds of my unused prostate, that even if I jump, they’ll still lose my paperwork.
