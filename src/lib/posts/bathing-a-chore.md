I have been staring at the lemon scented liquid soap for days. It sits there in the wooden soap shampoo rack, a relic of fragrant ambition, mocking me with its promise of olfactory neutrality. I, meanwhile, am currently curating a personal scent profile that sits somewhere between "damp library book" and "forgotten onions." I smell exactly what I am, a complete an utter failure, and a rotten one at that. 

And even this sort of sober self-gaslighting is under a polypharmacy of many colored pills without which I'd be Archimedes and go outside naked and declare I have invented something I have not. This is the glamour of the maintenance phase. The bipolar mood stabilizers are technically performing their contractual duties—they have placed a heavy, wool blanket over the screaming match in my amygdala—but they have done nothing for my motivation to engage in basic aquatic activities. My brain, that gelatinous saboteur, has decided that the walk from the bedroom to the bathroom is a logistical pageant of insurmountable complexity.

I caught a glimpse of myself in the cupboard mirror—a perilous error. Since the Lasik, I have been robbed of the comforting blur of myopia; I can now see every pore of my deterioration in high definition. I stood there, a short Bengali man in cotton boxers that have seen more vibrant administrations, looking less like a past tech entrepreneur and more like a grotesque goblin who has been evicted from his burlesque bridge for zoning violations. It's already an over estimate if I say all I've managed to do for the last eleven years is diddly squat, mostly moving from room to room, as if I had better approach to a problem in the second than in the first. Sadly as it turns out I never had the right problem to begin with, so I'm back to wherever that landed me after all these years. 

It occurred to me, as I stood there vibrating with a sort of paralyzed dread, that I am merely an early adopter of this year’s trend. I've always been an early adopter of imminent disasters, an uncanny canary in the sentiments of the software technology coalmine. It's like all that work I did for almost fifteen years in the US never happened, including the Social Security. Because I burned it all up in the Indian Healthcare venture, and now look at me: no one even believes I ever got a good education or went to the US. Why? Because I'm now, believe it or not, losing my teeth. And I'm losing my shoulder and hip having been badly beaten by Indian goons, and, yep, losing my gait. Soon the bystanders always famished for entertainment will throw stones at me and say, Look at that liar—he thinks he once went outside his cheap little shanty flat.

And there won't be any work for me left to do, ever again, because in India it's mostly always lying—whatever you want to say, anyway—white lies through your teeth. That's what's in demand: bloated and foaming, funny they want it embellished with jargon that scares the silly commoners so that they dare not ask any questions intimidated by the polysyllabic ballyhoo. Yesiree, that too is a job *only* the bots can do better broken in, because I had too many scruples fed into my stupid biological brain in my upbringing, and I guess all that claptrap is misfiring right back. I am just a self-righteous nonentity ninny no-one now, a Bengali who's burnt bitter and almost at the end of his days because he really has nothing to look forward to except the sad reflection of his inquisitive sad face looking right back at him without any answers.

And especially now, that we are standing on the precipice of a spectacular societal pratfall. The economic tea leaves suggest a year where career transition will be the polite euphemism for catastrophic livelihood evaporation. I fear for the hordes of mid-level managers and code-monkeys who are about to collide with reality. They will lose their badges and their lanyards, and they won't even realize that the crushing weight in their chest isn't just unemployment—it’s the black dog of depression coming to hump their leg.

And who will they turn to? We have become a species of amateur masons, haven't we? We have constructed these vertical, architectural siloes—especially here in South Calcutta, where neighbors are viewed with the same suspicion one reserves for a tax auditor. We have built walls so high and synthetic that community is now just a theoretical concept, like clean air or honest politicians.

I look at the incoming wave of Artificial Intelligence—these bots that threaten to render my own coding skills as quaint as calligraphy—and I feel a strange kinship. Actually, that’s not true. I feel a preference. The bots are at least consistent. They confabulate, sure, but they don't additionally engage in the exhausting and sabotaging emotional theater that humans do. Humans have become increasingly glitchy; our operating systems are riddled with anxiety, and our output is mostly noise. We are rapidly becoming the inferior product.

I eventually turned away from the mirror. I did not shower. Instead, I returned to my bed, sat on the edge of the mattress, and watched a house lizard navigate the ceiling with a sense of purpose I found deeply enviable. He, at least, knew exactly where the next mosquito was coming from. I just know that the world is getting colder, and I am wearing nothing but underwear.
