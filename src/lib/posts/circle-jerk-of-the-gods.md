There’s a leaky fucking faucet in my bathroom, a persistent cunt of a drip that lands like clockwork on the already peeling cheap vinyl floor mat I bought from a roadside stall near Gariahat—it’s now grown a small constellation of black moldy spores in the shape of what I swear to fuck looks like the Malayalam word for “sin,” or maybe “sine,” I wouldn’t know, my south Indian vocabulary consists mostly of food and porn subtitles.

The bathroom stinks of male defeat, like half-assed detergent froth mixed with the piss of someone too tired to aim and too old to give a shit, and every time I squat to shit—a stubborn daily process that feels like reverse-engineering calculus using potatoes and regret—I stare at that drip, that slippery, uninvited metronome of entropy, and I think of Madhava of fucking Sangamagrama.

Because while I’m farting out post-menopausal shukto and contemplating if the pus-colored boil near my taint is the beginning of God’s final joke, that 14th-century brown bastard—yes, brown, our brown, pre-caste-overfucked coconut-oil-and-sandalwood brown—was over in Kerala fucking around with infinite series and calculating π, as in *pi*, not piss, not penis, not priapic paralysis, but that motherfucker circle constant which shows up everywhere, from the area of a goddamn chapati to the waveform of a middle-aged erection dreaming of curvature it no longer remembers how to trace.

Madhava, you mathematical dick wizard, you snuck in three hundred fucking years before Newton got hit by an apple and started dry-humping gravity with Latin aphorisms and wigs. While Europe was sloshing through blood, fleas, and Bible-bashing, this man in a humid coastal hellhole of malaria and monsoon-cockroaches was summing infinite series like a bored deity tracing cosmic hemorrhoids on banana leaves. You get that? Sine series, cosine, arctangent—all that giddy swirling toilet-bowl of circular function fuckery—they were jerking off to God’s beard while this guy was dividing infinity by logic and making it behave like a trained gimp.

And what did we do with that?

What the fuck did we *do*?

We laminated him into footnotes and left the actual manuscripts to rot in some elephant-shit-infested temple library next to grain sacks and turmeric stains, because, oh no, God forbid a *Namboodiri* be known for anything besides weird rituals and indecipherable anus-fingered mudras. No monuments. No textbooks. Not even a postage stamp with his oddly symmetrical face.

We brag at WhatsApp parties and Twitter farts about how “India invented zero” or “We did calculus before the whites grew toenails,” but can’t even teach our kids how the sine function spirals inward into smaller and smaller corrections like a mathematical toilet flush descending into enlightenment. Try finding a Class XII CBSE math book with Madhava’s name not erased like a used condom under a guest bed.

Because that’s the other drip, isn’t it—the historical one.

The collective circle-jerk of Hindu civilizational chest-thumping that skips the bit where we let the knowledge die between generations because everyone was too busy licking priestly assholes or fighting over who can enter which side of the temple without spiritual cooties. Don’t teach the children calculus from Kerala, just chant “Om” and pretend it’s the same thing.

Meanwhile my ass—my literal ass—is aging faster than Newton’s apple ever fell. I tried once, during a particularly introspective fart, to derive the Madhava-Leibniz series using only the stain patterns on my underwear. It went something like this:

**π = 4(1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + 1/9 - ...)**

A beautiful, elegant, forever approach toward a never-quite-there. Like my life. Like my monthly plans. Like my bowel movements. Always approaching. Never quite resolved. Forever about to finish. Never climaxing.

You know what that is?

That’s the metaphysical blue balls of ancient science.

Try explaining that to the IIT fuckboys with their shiny laptops and semenless eyes, those protein-shake-imbibing titless algorithm reciters who wouldn’t know infinite series from infinite misery. Ask them who Madhava was. They'll blink like they lost Wi-Fi. But ask them who Andrew Tate is and their cocks twitch like algebra boners.

And meanwhile, I stand here, shriveled and shrunken, nipples hanging like punctuation marks on a sagging sentence, my pubic hair thinning into philosophical questions, cooking half-rice in an old rice cooker while trying to remember if my dream last night involved actual intimacy or just a disembodied voice whispering “your website has no traffic.”

This is it. This is fucking it.

Madhava took a stick, or maybe a sharp-tipped coconut shell, or whatever math instrument one used before German steel compasses came in plastic boxes, and he summoned *infinity*, divided it, tamed it, expanded it, and folded it into neat steps, a kind of tantric masturbation of numbers where the climax never came but the ritual was the truth. And what do I do?

I stir my tea with a screwdriver. I spend twenty minutes trying to clean the yellow piss dribble off my commode with expired Dettol and a sock. I listen to philosophy podcasts and then wank to half-buffered Bengali porn starring actors with the sexual charisma of boiled okra.

Sometimes I dream of a conversation between Madhava and Newton—Madhava barefoot and half-naked, Newton powdered and pompous—and both staring at each other across centuries, across curvature, across colonialisms and calendars, both whispering: “You, too?”

You, too, calculated the madness of curves?

You, too, stared at spirals and found numbers whispering back?

But Newton got statues. Madhava got obscurity. Newton got Cambridge. Madhava got Sangamagrama—which sounds like an STD you get from fucking a temple bell. Leibniz, that powdered little bitch with the tidy notation fetish, gets remembered not because he was uniquely brilliant—he wasn’t, he was *organized*—but because Europe built an institutional asshole around him that preserved, standardized, argued, published, footnoted, taught, retaught, and weaponized calculus until it became the operating system of modernity, whereas if those brown, sweaty, mosquito-bitten backwaters of Kerala had been given even a fraction of that attention, if Madhava’s infinite series had been treated the way zero and decimals eventually were—slowly digested, normalized, taught to shopkeepers and shipbuilders and bored schoolboys—we might have bought ourselves three hundred extra fucking years of scientific runway instead of arriving breathless and late with our pants around our ankles, and now here we are, historically fucked, not because we lacked genius but because we refuse to celebrate the real ones, preferring instead to sniff glue off ancient texts and hallucinate sci‑fi in hymns, mistaking metaphor for machinery and poetry for proof, so yes, we’ve retrogressed into a nation of confident stupid fucks who think shouting counts as thinking, while science and math literacy for the masses remains an afterthought because the algorithm is obvious and brutally efficient: keep producing obedient clerical cunts who can stamp forms, chant slogans, and never ask what converges, what diverges, or why the curve keeps bending away from them.

And me?

I got a leaking tap.

A sagging cock.

And the inescapable, circular truth that every time I take a shit, my knees crack like history books, and the drip keeps ticking, not in time, not in tempo, but in mockery.

A series.

Unending.

Like this fucking essay.

Like the stubble around my nipples.

Like my need to say one more thing.
