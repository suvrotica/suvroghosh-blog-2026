I am sitting on the toilet at six in the morning, knees apart, belly hanging like a defeated sack of wet cement, waiting for the shit to decide whether it wants to be solid or philosophical, when it hits me—not the shit, the other thing—that there is absolutely nobody I want to tell this to, not the toilet part obviously, but the part where the body becomes the only audience left, the asshole its own confessional, the tiled bathroom a church with no god and excellent acoustics for farts.

The shit comes out half-formed, embarrassed, like it knows it shouldn’t exist in public, and I sweat in that sour winter way Calcutta does, cold air outside, sticky armpits inside, the body unable to agree with itself, which feels like a pretty accurate metaphor for my entire fucking life, fifty years of internal committee meetings ending in nothing, no resolution, just a smell.

My mother would worry if I told her this, my sister would try to fix it with logistics and tone, so I keep them wrapped in distance like old crockery you don’t want to chip, and everyone says family is everything but they never tell you that “everything” often means silence, a polite refusal to contaminate each other with the real textures of living, the skid marks of thought. I flush, the toilet roars like a small angry river, and that’s the loudest conversation I’ve had all week.

There is one friend, technically, a work friend, a man who runs on ambition like a cheap generator, loud, erratic, full of smoke, dreaming of Bugattis and billionaire spreadsheets, always hustling some new shortcut to infinite rupees and relevance. He talks in IPOs and Instagram Reels, as if luxury were a birthright stolen by bad timing, and I listen, mostly because arguing with superlative ambition is like trying to fistfight a mirror. He’s always winning in his own story—net worth going up, enemies vanquished, destiny beckoning—and I nod like a neutered consultant at a crypto seminar, because explaining to him that I’ve never really given a fuck about money or power or the LinkedIn food chain feels like a losing proposition. His dreams gallop; mine sleep standing up.

I dry myself with a towel that smells faintly of mildew and regret, catch my reflection in the mirror, the belly, the droop, the eyes that look like they’ve been waiting in a government office since 1998, and I think: this is the face of nothing. Not tragic nothing, not heroic nothing, just administrative nothing, a file mislaid between departments. I masturbated last night out of boredom, not desire, scrolling porn the way one scrolls news during a riot—too much, too fast, everyone screaming, nobody touching me—and came with a sigh that sounded like a bus braking, afterward lying there with the damp patch cooling and the thought that if I died right then, the room wouldn’t notice until the smell changed.

Loneliness is supposed to be dramatic, violins and rain and longing glances, but mostly it’s just logistics: who do you text when your stomach hurts, who do you tell that the dream you had involved a woman from twenty years ago who wouldn’t look at you and a classroom full of people laughing while you tried to hide a hard-on behind a schoolbag like a guilty child. I woke up sweaty, ashamed, hard for no reason that could survive daylight, the body still insisting on rehearsals for a play that closed decades ago.

I have read too many books for this to be interesting. I know the evolutionary arguments, the primate grooming, the colonial loneliness of cities designed for extraction not comfort, the neuroscience of social pain lighting up the same circuits as physical pain, and none of that stops me from eating leftover rice standing at the counter, fingers greasy, thinking about how my blog has become a kind of latrine wall where I scratch messages to nobody in particular, proof of existence like a turd left unflushed: someone was here, briefly, and it was unpleasant.

The city outside coughs and groans, buses farting diesel, construction hammering at yesterday’s mistakes, and I imagine Calcutta itself as a giant aging body, arteries clogged, joints creaking, everyone pretending vitality while leaking, and maybe that’s why I fit so well here now, an exile within an exile, old North Calcutta’s ghosts shaking their heads at me from cracked verandas, Satyajit Ray’s calm faces watching this shitshow and politely declining to comment.

Politics used to give me erections, or at least a sense of purpose, slogans and marches and the warm press of bodies, but that dried up too, the way arousal does when you’ve seen the trick too many times. Now nationalism feels like erectile dysfunction for a whole country, all bluster and no blood flow, and spirituality feels like porn with the sound off, everyone pretending transcendence while rubbing themselves raw on metaphors.

I try to pee and it comes out in two streams, disagreeing, splashing the rim, and I laugh because even my piss can’t commit to a direction. The abstract idea of “nothing” lives in the gut like gas, invisible but insistent, a pressure that makes you shift in your seat, and when philosophers talk about the void I want to tell them it smells faintly of shit and cheap soap and old cum, it sounds like silence punctured by neighbors’ televisions, it feels like a phone that never vibrates.

There are inappropriate memories that surface like pimples when I’m alone too long: a woman on a bus brushing my arm thirty years ago, a teacher’s blouse straining, a hand held too briefly, all of them useless now, museum pieces of desire that still manage to make my dick twitch like it’s remembering a password the brain has forgotten. Erotic shame is mostly archival, the body hoarding moments the mind would rather delete, and every time I scroll porn I’m just rearranging the archive, dusting the same dead exhibits.

I eat, I shit, I sweat, I scroll, I sleep badly, and in between I tell myself stories about being a rationalist, an atheist, a man of thought, when really I am a mammal with Wi‑Fi, a sack of fluids convinced it has opinions. The blog exists because talking requires a listener and writing only requires gravity and time, words falling out like dandruff, accumulating until someone might notice the flakes.

Sometimes I imagine dying and the problem isn’t fear, it’s administration: who calls whom, what happens to the browser tabs, who explains the smell. That’s when I realize the body is the only thing consistently present, the asshole the most honest orifice, always telling the truth about what’s been passing through.

I lie on the bed in the afternoon, half-hard for no one, scratching my balls while some old Ray film plays on mute, the actors noble and composed while I adjust my dick so it doesn’t point accusingly at the ceiling fan, and I think about how this is the sum total: a man alone with culture, history, pornography, and a digestive system that never shuts up. Nothing, yes—but nothing with a body, which is worse, because bodies insist, they keep producing evidence.

I fall asleep briefly and wake to the sound of my own fart, sharp and wet, echoing in the room like applause from a very small audience, and for a moment I consider clapping back, acknowledging the only response I’m likely to get.
