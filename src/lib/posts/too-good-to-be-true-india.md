I was crouched over the plastic Western toilet that pretends to flush like a real one but gurgles like a drowning buffalo, peeling off the moist strip of toilet paper that had somehow fused into my ass crack like those laminated barcode stickers they put on LPG cylinders, wondering—not for the first time—if I had rectally absorbed yet another fungal infection from the last time the water tank wasn’t cleaned and the pipe brought in liquid diarrhea straight from the Hooghly.  

This is where hope lives in India. In the whorled ring of an asshole clenched against betrayal.

See, in India, the moment anything seems smooth, polished, even faintly competent—an app interface that works, a plumber who arrives on time, a government scheme with actual disbursal—you must recoil like a man who just found a boner in his own mouth during a dream. Because it will fall apart. It will implode. It will self-detonate like a pre-paid mobile plan caught in a neutron star’s gravitational reach. And when it does, you will find yourself, as I did, one leg raised like an arthritic flamingo, reaching for Dettol with the panicked flailing of a man trying to put out a fire using piss.  

Take the broadband guy, for instance. He came. Yes, came. Not like the verb in the adult films but the actual miracle: he *showed up*. With tools. Wires. A fucking tester. He even *smiled*—that soft, neutered corporate smile worn by those who've been forced to complete a “customer delight” training module made by a Canadian who’s never seen a power cut. He fixed the fiber line, ran a speed test, *explained* the jitter graph. It was *too good*. Too straight. Too fucking normal. So of course, twelve hours later, the whole line was rerouted to someone else’s goddamn account, and my connection now services the astrologer downstairs who believes the Wi-Fi interferes with his Vishuddha chakra.  

Physics has laws. India has punishments for expecting them to work.

This country operates like a turd floating in Schrödinger's toilet—both flushed and not flushed, depending on whether the municipality inspector is visiting your ward that day or attending the fifth cousin’s Ganesh puja opening ceremony of a new sweet shop that also sells SIM cards and does Aadhaar linking in the back.  

The middle class here, oh the motherfucking middle class, runs on denial the way diesel generators run in blackout zones. Denial and EMIs. When something works—say a footbridge doesn't collapse or a payment clears without a bribe—it’s taken as *auspicious*. Like a planetary alignment. Rahu got bored. Mercury didn't retrograde. Or the engineer didn’t drink Old Monk for breakfast.  

Because systems, here, are not *systems*. They are *gestures*. 

Which brings me to the tea kettle. My beloved fucking electric tea kettle. Bought online during one of those idiotic “Big Billion” sales where everything's supposedly 80% off but ships with the gravitational sadness of being repackaged by underpaid teens with an ear infection. It worked like a dream. For *four days*. Then it hissed like a snake with TB and tripped the entire house. Turns out, it wasn’t grounded. Not metaphorically. *Electrically*. I could've died making chai. Imagine the obituary: “Man found half-boiled, dick out, corpse smelling faintly of Lipton.”  

But nobody would investigate. They’d say, “Arrey, must have been his time.”  

You’d think, maybe, science would save us. But no. In India, even entropy has a bureaucracy. Everything decays *with supervision*. Government schools decay with a teacher who signs in but never shows. Flyovers decay with vendors frying pakoras on the expansion joints. Bodies decay in hospitals where the only refrigeration works in the canteen selling stale idlis for ₹80.  

Trust dies here. Not in flames, but in gurgles. Like the sound my geyser makes when it pretends to heat.  

Once I tried to get a water purifier repaired. Big brand. I called the helpline. Spoke to three voices that were definitely generated by some AI bot trained on English call center trauma. A guy arrived two weeks later. He looked fifteen. Wore no badge. Smelled like onion bhaji and Lynx body spray. Fixed something, took cash, and *vanished*. Turned out he wasn't from Aquaguard. He was from WhatsApp. Like, literally. A WhatsApp contact. The real company denied him. I had basically invited a teenage conman to fuck my filtration membrane.  

And I *paid* him.  

We’re a country where the false version of anything is easier to access than the real thing. Fake doctor? Every lane. Fake saffron robe? ₹100. Fake organic eggs? Why not. Fake nationalism? Oh boy. You can’t swing your dick without slapping a cow-worshipping loudmouth whose last brush with patriotism was downloading a Salman Khan biopic torrent.  

This is why in India the moment something is beautiful—honestly, staggeringly good—your instinct should not be gratitude but *panic*. 

That job offer? It’s got an HR clause hidden in the offer letter that says your salary will be performance-linked to the number of times you say “sir” in meetings.

That girl who laughed at your joke and touched your arm? She’s selling real estate or crypto or maybe her cousin needs a kidney. Yours.

That government app that seems to work? Don’t. It’s harvesting your location, contacts, Aadhaar, PAN, sexual fantasies, and your mother’s weight.  

This paranoia isn’t cynicism. It’s *hygiene*. Like washing your ass after using the toilet—which, ironically, also doesn’t happen in half the households here because people believe wiping with newspaper gives you character.

You know what character I’ve got now? Fungal.  

Every time I feel a twinge of optimism—like maybe, just maybe, the shipment will arrive on time, or the government portal won’t crash at 11:59 pm on the last day to file returns—I develop a rash. A literal one. Optimism manifests as hives on my lower back and occasionally an erection so ill-timed and limp it looks like a sock full of regret.  

Which is fair, because this country has taught me the *physics* of disappointment. Not the “oh, that's sad” kind. No, the Newtonian, gravitation-pulled, iron-ball-to-your-nutsack kind of disappointment. The energy conserved is always humiliation.  

Because nothing real works here without jugaad, grease, or groveling. Nothing. And the people who claim otherwise are either lying, NRI, or own shares in Paytm.  

I once tried to buy a decent pair of scissors. Ended up with a pair that cut at 37 degrees to the plane of intention. You try cutting paper and it tears diagonally into the shape of Kashmir. Maybe it was a metaphor. Or maybe some fucker in the assembly line was just high.  

Either way, the scissors don’t work.

And I still can’t find the original invoice.
