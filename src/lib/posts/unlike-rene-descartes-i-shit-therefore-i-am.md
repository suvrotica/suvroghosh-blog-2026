The first philosophical fart I remember—a proper throat-scorching, morally ambiguous fart, not the comic “oops” variety that sneaks out like a confessional monk—happened at exactly 3:14 a.m. in a concrete toilet that sounded like it was built over a disused artillery range, and smelt like Nietzsche’s armpit after a sauna orgy with Hegel and a durian fruit. 

I was perched, hunched, near-naked, vulnerable, sweating like a guilt-soaked goat on Bakr Eid, on a toilet that trembled slightly every time a lorry thundered past the bypass like a rabid minotaur late for court. And it hit me. Not the shit, that had already hit. I mean the realisation. Unlike René fucking Descartes, who got to ponder mind-body bullshit with candlelight and a quill and probably lace around his manly wrists, I had no luxury of disembodied thought. I was there, present, every fucking atom of me, a one-man biohazard event crouched over 20 rupees of reheated egg curry trying to exit through my asshole like a jailbreak with fingernails.

I shit, therefore I am. Fuck “cogito.” What is thought but a faint ripple in the bowel-mucus of being? You think you are, I KNOW I am, because this thing right here—this basal geyser of ancestral bile and chemical regret—is what anchors me to a universe that does not give one creaky cunt-hair about syllogism.

The pain in my gut was not metaphor. It was the *anti*-metaphor. It was the body launching a civil war against every pretense of civility. 

And in that moment—eye-watering, spine-curving, ass-cheeks clenching with the hopeless optimism of a Catholic at a condom counter—I began to understand what no French fuck ever could: the body is not a prison of the mind, it is the fucking warden, the executioner, the jailhouse choir, and the guy in the cell next to you furiously masturbating with a hand lotion he made from powdered milk and spite.

Anyway.

This isn’t some poetic diversion about illness. It’s just how I wake up most mornings now—gut-fluttered, heat-logged, ass fizzing like a science experiment nobody remembers authorizing. I've lived in this particular Southern Calcutta concrete oven long enough to know my bowels are no longer private. The neighbors probably have names for my different morning soundtracks. There’s the “bubbly Bengali samba,” the “plunger of doom,” and of course, the infamous “who brought the trumpet and set it on fire?”

The rice cooker stares at me, judgey little cunt. Like it knows what it’s done.

And always, somewhere in this grotesque orchestra of autonomic rebellion, I start *thinking*, like an idiot, which only makes it worse.

That’s when Descartes returns like a smug old substitute teacher with a detachable nose and opinions about coffee. “I think, therefore I am.” Fuck off, René. You had servants. You probably thought while constipated in a castle. Try thinking when the toilet water hits your balls because your downstairs neighbor also flushed, and the septic pipe has been repurposed from World War II submarine parts.

The real human condition is the stomach.

Not the brain. The stomach. The gut flora. The microbial parliament that decides your mood, your memory, your politics, and yes, the exact velocity of the diarrhea that now paints your porcelain with the reckless abandon of a Pollock possessed by dysentery.

You want to understand free will? Try holding in a shit on a bus with no AC in May. See how long your fucking agency lasts.

Meanwhile, philosophers for centuries have wanked on and on about soul, being, the metaphysics of perception—all of which evaporate instantly when you have to decide whether to shit in your underwear or behind a small parked Alto. The mind isn’t superior to the body—it’s a late add-on, like those Bluetooth-enabled LED lights on rikshaws. Flashy. Distracting. Ultimately not doing shit when you hit a pothole full of vomit and dead frogs.

But the bowels—they *know*. 

They are honest. Brutal. Comically democratic. Doesn’t matter if you're a Brahmin with seven PhDs or a bastard from Burrabazar with a tea stall and no sphincter control—when the gut decides, the body follows.

Maybe that’s what scared the fuck out of old Descartes. Maybe he shat himself once and never recovered.

Which brings me, inevitably, to the Kolkata sewage system.

Because let me tell you something, when your philosophical epiphany depends on being able to evacuate your existential sludge without splashing back amoebic time-travelers from the 1800s into your asshole, the stakes get real. There’s a pipe outside my house—just one, not even ashamed of itself—jutting out like a drunk uncle’s erection, occasionally burping out what I can only describe as post-colonial regret. That pipe *knows* more about the human condition than all of Santiniketan.

What’s worse is that I still eat the same food. I still reheat the fucking curry. I pour dal with the dead stare of a man spoon-feeding his own execution. I add green chili like a flag of doomed pride. Because this is all I know. Cook. Eat. Shit. Regret. Repeat.

The loop is life.

Not progress, not joy, not fulfillment. Just a slightly soggy loop, like an old banyan undergarment that’s been washed too many times but still holds your sad little penis in a vaguely supportive hug.

Maybe that’s why nobody writes real philosophy anymore. We’ve outsourced our pain to apps, our cravings to gig economy losers, our farts to exhaust fans and lavender-scented aerosols. Nobody wants to confront the real *I am* that lives in the rectum.

We’re living in a culture of constipation. Psychologically, socially, even gastronomically.

That’s why I don’t trust spiritual people. The “cleansed” ones. Anyone whose asshole hasn’t had a breakdown recently is hiding something. I don’t want enlightenment. I want a toilet that doesn’t gurgle like it’s being exorcised by diarrheal demons.

I shit, therefore I am.

I shit, and I remember I’m not a brand. I’m not a career. I’m not a profile. I’m not an opinion. I’m not a legacy. I’m not even a person.

I’m just a temporarily coherent tube through which matter passes, occasionally screaming.

And you know what?

That’s fucking beautiful.

No. Not beautiful. That’s the wrong word.

Accurate.
