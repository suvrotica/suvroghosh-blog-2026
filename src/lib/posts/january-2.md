I woke up early to the loud voices of the people who own—and rent, and sublet, and generally *possess*—the two SUVs parked right in front of my bedroom window, as if my sleep were an unpaid roadside tax and their morning gossip the official receipt. They weren’t angry exactly, just vigorously alive in that way people get when they have vehicles large enough to confer moral authority; the kind of voices that bounce off metal, multiply, and arrive in your skull as a committee decision. Outside, the street was already doing its usual Kolkata rehearsal—horns clearing throats, a distant drill warming up like a bad tabla player, air with that faint aftertaste of yesterday’s combustion—and above the haze a bird crossed, small and single-minded, like the world’s last unsponsored headline.

On the sill there’s a light snowfall of gray: not snow, obviously—this city doesn’t do European romance, it does particulate matter—but a soft ash that could be from last night’s fireworks, or the roadwork, or the general combustion of modern life. I wipe it with my finger and it smears like bad eyeliner. *Auspicious*, I think, because we Bengalis have the spiritual gift of calling everything auspicious right up to the moment we’re in an ICU, at which point we switch to calling it fate. 

It’s an odd talent, this ability to celebrate a number on a page as if the universe itself has undergone a factory reset.

January 2. A date that means absolutely nothing in my personal history except that the tea tastes the same and the air tastes worse. A date whose significance is the bureaucratic aftertaste of Christianity—because yes, the world’s calendar is basically a missionary tract with better graphic design. The Gregorian calendar is, in effect, a successful export product: it arrives with empire, it settles into your pocket, and after a while you start defending it like it’s your own grandmother’s recipe. We grumble about foreign influence while arranging our lives around a Roman Pope’s math homework. The funny thing about the Gregorian calendar—this allegedly neutral grid we pretend is just “how time works”—is that it isn’t even trying to be neutral. It’s a fossil record of Rome’s obsessions, patched by popes, laundered through empire, and handed to the rest of us like a “universal standard,” the way a bully hands you his idea of friendship.

Even the word *month* is a confession. It comes from the moon—Old English *mōnaþ*, Latin *mensis*, both tied to measuring by lunar cycles, because for most of human history the sky was the only clock that didn’t break or get stolen. We’ve since upgraded to atomic clocks and satellite time signals—cesium atoms doing their immaculate little wiggle like metronomes in a vacuum—yet we still drag around this old lunar vocabulary as if the moon is our payroll department.

And then the names. January is Janus, the two-faced Roman god of doorways and beginnings—very on-brand for a month that feels like standing in a threshold while someone shouts behind you to “move forward.” February comes from *februa*, purification rites, a month named after ritual cleaning—delicious, considering it’s when the air in my city feels least clean. March is Mars, April may or may not be from *aperire* (“to open”)—the etymology is disputed, which is perfect because April itself can’t decide what it is—May is Maia, June is Juno, and then the calendar stops even pretending to be poetic and turns into a carved plaque for powerful men: July for Julius Caesar, August for Augustus. After that come the months that accidentally reveal the calendar’s sloppy history: September, October, November, December—*seven, eight, nine, ten* in Latin, except they’re sitting in slots nine through twelve like misnumbered seats at a wedding where nobody wants to admit the chart was wrong. That mismatch isn’t mystical; it’s just bureaucracy with a toga. The early Roman year began in March, then reforms happened, politics happened, emperors happened, and now we all recite the mistakes as tradition.

The days do the same trick—astronomy dressed up as theology dressed up as routine. Sunday and Monday are straightforward enough: Sun’s day, Moon’s day. Then English takes a wonderfully pagan detour: Tuesday from Tiw (a Germanic war god), Wednesday from Woden/Odin, Thursday from Thor, Friday from Frigg (or possibly Freyja—scholars still argue, which again feels apt), Saturday keeping the Roman Saturn like a stubborn foreign uncle who refuses to learn Bengali. It’s a whole pantheon hiding in plain sight, a weekly roll call of gods most people claim not to believe in while setting alarms for them.

And that’s where the postcolonial absurdity gets almost tenderly comic: I can say “Wednesday” with a straight face in a country where my grandparents could say *Budhbar* just as easily—Budha, Mercury; *Sombar*, the moon; *Mangalbar*, Mars; *Gurubar*, Jupiter; *Shukrobar—শুক্রবার*, Venus; *Shanibar*, Saturn; *Ravibar*, the sun—another planetary week, another cosmology, different paint on the same old human need to staple meaning onto rotations and revolutions. Time doesn’t come named. We name it because namelessness makes us nervous. Then, once named, we start saluting the names as if they were the thing itself.

And yet—here we are. India, land of five thousand years of self-congratulation, marking the birth year of a Galilean Jew with the fervor of newly hired accountants. We do it with cake, confetti, and a level of noise that suggests we’re trying to frighten away the demon of continuity. *Dekho, dekho!* New year! New me! New promises! New speeches! New hashtags! Meanwhile the molecules in the air do not care. Nitrogen dioxide does not pause for prayer.

There’s a word the philosophers use—*skyhooks*—for those imaginary supports people insist are holding up reality. As if there’s a hook in the sky from which your life hangs neatly like a shirt on a hanger, dry and crease-free, and if you chant the right syllables or buy the right calendar or clap at midnight, the hook will hold. It’s comforting, like believing your landlord is honest.

The thing about arbitrary dates is that they become sacred the moment a crowd agrees to pretend. Humans will sanctify anything: a rock, a flag, a man in a kurta, a number. The arbitrariness is the point. It proves obedience. If you can get millions of people to feel something on command because the rectangle on the wall says so, you’ve basically hacked the species.

I’m not immune. I resent it, yes, but I also feel its tug, because I’m a primate with a frontal lobe and a childhood full of rituals. Even my skepticism has rituals. I make tea the same way, I line books up and pretend that’s order rather than a museum of unfinished lives. I check the AQI like a hypochondriac checks a pulse. Numbers soothe us because they’re clean—until you realize the air isn’t.

Someone somewhere is always having the kind of disaster that doesn’t fit in your news feed.

I read, half-awake, about a fire in Switzerland—clean, efficient Switzerland, the place that looks like it was designed by a committee of competent engineers—burning, because the universe enjoys irony and will not let any country hoard safety like it’s chocolate. A big fire becomes a headline because scale makes it legible. But there are always smaller fires: a cylinder explosion in a slum, a short circuit in a wedding tent, a kitchen blaze that eats three rooms and two lives and then disappears into the statistics like it never had names.

And then the road accidents. Those are our true national festival. We don’t even need a calendar for them. Every day is a sacrificial offering to speed, alcohol, potholes, and the peculiar Indian belief that the laws of physics are negotiable if you honk loudly enough. We kill people in bulk and call it “unfortunate,” as if misfortune arrived from outside, like a courier, rather than being manufactured locally with great enthusiasm.

The second day of January, if you really want to honor it, should be observed by standing at a crossing and watching how many people try to outrun a turning bus. There’s your religion: momentum.

Closer to home, the city has that post-firecracker hangover. The air feels bruised. The morning light comes in dull, like it’s been filtered through a cheap bedsheet. Somewhere nearby, men are digging up a road for reasons that will never be explained, and the dust is so fine it seems to have been engineered. It lifts, it hangs, it enters you. It coats the tongue. It’s intimate—more intimate than most relationships I’ve had lately.

I can handle the metaphysics of meaninglessness. I can’t handle lungs full of contractor dust.

And then the water.

Indore—again, this is just what I saw and what everyone forwards with the same concerned emojis they use for celebrity divorces—had people dying after drinking polluted potable water. The phrase itself is a little joke: *polluted potable*. Like *honest politician*. Like *pure ghee* in a country that has turned adulteration into an art form and then acts shocked when the canvas poisons the buyer.

<Yt src="https://youtu.be/icjhOQkzqVg?si=UNX_jiwlFP6DL1vF" />

What kills me isn’t just the contamination. It’s the choreography around it.

People who throw wool over your eyes on every contentious issue—health, air, food, water, roads, medicine—those same people cannot be expected to volunteer to safeguard you. They will not. They never did. They will raise their voices only after the fact, when the bodies are already arranged into a narrative. They will hold microphones like incense sticks. They will perform outrage the way we perform patriotism: loudly, briefly, and at a safe distance from responsibility.

And you—meaning me, meaning the ordinary citizen who has learned helplessness the way children learn multiplication tables—will feel soothed by the mere sound of it. Words are sedatives. You’ll tell yourself something is being done because somebody said something. Everything becomes post-mortem reaction. We treat governance like it’s astrology: you don’t prevent the bad thing; you interpret it afterward and call that wisdom.

As long as it’s not biting your own ass.

But when it does bite—when the air gets into your child’s lungs, when the water gets into your mother’s kidneys, when the adulterant gets into your bloodstream—you will not be saved by slogans. You’ll be sick, dying, or dead, and your last clear thought will be: *I should’ve bought the damn filter.*

This is the absurd modern Indian ethic: we pay taxes for services we then privately purchase again because we do not trust the services. We are a nation of double payment. We buy water purifiers, air purifiers, UPS backups, private tuition, private security, private medicine. We are citizens in name and customers in practice. A republic run like a bad subscription model.

So yes, I am the crank who tells people to buy their own filters. It’s not virtue. It’s triage. And it comes with a bitter little epiphany: “public” is an adjective that has been quietly stolen from us, like my hope, like my hairline.

Somewhere in the middle of this sour thought-spiral, I open YouTube and let piano music leak into the room. Not the grand concert-hall kind—the kind where the pianist has to wear a suit and look spiritually tortured—but the internet kind: a performer like Gamazda or Alisa Procenko, somewhere far away, framed by a camera and a quiet room, playing for strangers who need company. There is something tenderly ridiculous about it. Civilization is collapsing in small ways, and meanwhile a person sits at a keyboard and translates grief into harmonics.

Sometimes it’s classical; sometimes it’s something perversely modern arranged into elegance—metal turned into lace. The notes fall into the room like clean water from a tap I don’t entirely trust.

I don’t tell anyone how much I need it, because men of my generation are trained to speak about feelings the way we speak about sexual health: indirectly, with jokes, or not at all. But it’s true. A piece of piano music can hold my head above the brown water of the day. It doesn’t cure anything. It simply makes the room briefly inhabitable.

Then I look outside again and see the neighborhood boy walking with a face that is—how do I put it—ridiculously smiley. The kind of smile that suggests either genuine joy or a total lack of observation. I feel a flash of jealousy so sharp it’s almost comic. I’m jealous of facial innocence. I’m jealous of people whose default expression isn’t a scowl carved by years of disappointment like a riverbed.

My scowl isn’t ideology. It’s muscle memory.

Sometimes I wonder if I am being unfair, if I’m just another performative intellectual in the costume of a rationalist, sneering at rituals while secretly craving them. It’s possible. The brain loves to smuggle needs under the border disguised as principles. Even atheists have altars; we just call them “bookshelves” and “data.”

I catch myself doing it now: making an argument out of mood, using politics as a vent for depression, using “society” as a target because it’s too exhausting to admit the simpler truth—that I’m lonely, and the calendar is a cheap prop that at least pretends to organize the chaos.

Still. Even my self-doubt has to share the room with facts.

The air is measurable. The water is testable. The causes of fires and road deaths are not mysterious. They are not cosmic. They are engineering problems, enforcement problems, education problems, corruption problems. They are failures of incentives, failures of institutions, failures of imagination.

And yet we treat them as if they are weather. We endure. We adapt. We scroll.

The most Indian thing about the New Year is not the celebration; it’s the speed with which we forget what we celebrated. By January 2, the optimism has already been converted into waste—plastic cups, leftover cake drying at the edges, a few sad balloons trapped in a tree like exhausted ideals. The streets are back to their real religion: commerce and convenience.

I see online—again, in the scroll, in the chatter—that there’s a new political figure in New York, a man named Mamdani, and people are hopeful in that bright Western way, as if governance is a machine that can be repaired by swapping one part. I don’t know enough to have an opinion worth anything, and that’s not modesty, that’s arithmetic: my information is thin, my cynicism is thick, and the combination makes a paste that sticks to everything.

Hope, when it appears, always looks a bit suspicious to me—like a man in a crisp white shirt on a humid day. How are you staying so clean? What are you hiding?

Still, I watch the hopeful faces and feel that jealousy again. Not because I dislike them. Because I can’t easily join them. Depression isn’t always sadness; sometimes it’s the inability to take good news at face value. Your brain starts interrogating joy like it’s a suspect.

I look back at the calendar. January 2. The square is quiet. It doesn’t demand celebration anymore. It just sits there, an official stamp on a day that will contain exactly what days contain: eating, excreting, worrying, waiting, and the occasional moment when music arrives and makes the air briefly less poisonous.

I wipe the windowsill again. The ash returns. It will always return. The universe is very consistent that way—entropy has a better work ethic than most governments.

Outside, a man in a vest is drilling into the road as if the road personally insulted him. Dust rises in a soft cloud and drifts toward my window with the slow confidence of something that knows it will get inside eventually. I close the pane, turn the piano up one notch, and watch January 2 sit in its little box, pretending it’s in charge. By evening the air has done what it always does when it’s allowed to roam free—set up camp in my throat. It’s sore now, that raw sandpaper feeling that makes swallowing a conscious act, and with it my bipolar emotions feel more flagrantly brittle, as if the day’s particulate has found not just my lungs but the hairline cracks in my mood and is cheerfully wedging itself in. It’s a nonalcoholic hangover—no party, no pleasure, just the body paying for other people’s fireworks and somebody’s road-digging and the general national hobby of pretending consequences are optional—and I can already tell it will linger like a fish bone stuck in the throat: tiny, stupid, impossible to ignore, clouding the first week of the year, which to me is now almost a meaningless random number that crowds insist on worshipping.
