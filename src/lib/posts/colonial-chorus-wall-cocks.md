The last time I heard “We Shall Overcome” in the wild—live, as in belched through human throats and not a nostalgia-embedded .mp3 buried in some forgotten RSS feed of revolutionary karaoke—I was squatting next to a drain in Dhakuria, trying to piss discreetly behind a wall someone built just high enough to hide a leaking stomach but not a soft dick. The smell was half-chlorine half-raw mango vomit and all of it reminding me, in one warm splash, of the school assembly mornings where we sang that very same song—our little brown mouths wide open, eyes on some rusty flag, our balls not yet dropped and our minds not yet fertilized by the pungent guano of modern Indian despair.

And that’s the fuckery, isn’t it?

They taught us to sing like little Gandhi-groupies, every single one of us a mini martinet of peace with our hair oiled and parts side-sliced, while the morning dew of urine and flatulence rose around us like some mist of future regret, and behind us, behind the colonial-ass convent wall, Sister Mary was probably fingering the beads of her rosary and also her cunt, while thinking of Calvary or some Tamil boy with legs like chicken drumsticks. And me? I was mouthing “We shall overcome someday” with all the conviction of a constipated monkey trying to pretend that shitting is a political act.

Spoiler: we didn’t overcome jack shit.

We became giants, yes. Fat, selfish, cement-hearted fucking giants with shiny marble floors, no empathy, ten CCTV cameras, twelve passwords, and one gaping hole where a soul should’ve been. We build walls. We love them. Physical, digital, emotional, psycho-sexual. Class walls, caste walls, cock-measuring walls. Walls that keep us from seeing each other’s eyes unless they’re filtered through a ring light or goddamn LinkedIn.

You ever been to a Bengali housing society WhatsApp group? No? It’s a testicle-shriveling horror show of all the worst instincts of humanity rolled into JPEGs, forwarded bullshit about “modular kitchen offers” and “slightly used treadmill” and some dumb motherfucker screaming in all caps about the fucking gate being left open. We used to march barefoot through slums singing about solidarity and now we hold emergency meetings because someone took too long to move their Kia Seltos.

I mean—fuck me with a sandal—how did we go from barefoot rebellion to air-conditioned pettiness so fast?

Look at the techie cunts around me. Thirty-something crorepatis with loose skin and tight sphincters who think owning a drone is revolution and sharing Elon Musk’s tweets is intellectualism. These are the same bastards who won’t let the maid use the lift. The same fucknuggets who post #gratitude selfies after their tenth Bali trip while ignoring the rickshaw puller who just pissed blood into a roadside gutter and died smelling like detergent and capitalism.

And me?

I sit here like a broken-down bidet, squirting nothing useful out, with half a career stuck in a spreadsheet and the other half stuffed up the prolapsed asshole of nostalgia. I still remember the line—“The selfish giant”—some textbook parable with more moral than meat, about a hairy fucker who builds a wall to keep the kids out of his garden and ends up dying alone, which, incidentally, is also the plot of every upper middle-class Indian marriage.

But here’s the true horror, the diabolical twist in this steaming biryani of disappointment: we *want* to be the selfish giant.

We *like* building walls. We *like* being isolated, pampered, cocooned in noise-cancelled ignorance. We *like* watching climate change updates on OLED screens while our terrace tanks boil off into the stratosphere. We *like* jacking off to porn made by women who can't afford their own tampons because we clicked skip on the ad that might've paid them. We don’t want to overcome. We want to *enjoy the view* from the top of our own defecation pile.

Overcome? Please.

We can’t even overcome lactose intolerance without a support group.

The only thing we’ve successfully overcome is the ability to feel shame. It’s not just us—look at the world. America’s balls are hanging out of its jeans, Britain’s still jerking itself off with colonial guilt lotion, China’s busy filming everyone’s arsehole in 4K, and we’re here writing Sanskrit slogans on sewage pumps and calling it Vikas.

What the fuck are we even?

What the fuck am *I* even?

I sit with my legs cramping from squatting too long, surrounded by walls I built with my own stupidity: emotional, financial, gastrointestinal. I wall myself in with habits—sodium, porn, late-night doomscrolls, the inability to say “no” to cockamamie partnerships that go nowhere but still manage to syphon time like a particularly charming herpes outbreak.

My body’s a wall too. A barricade of softness and unexpressed grief, collapsing vertebrae, and the unexploded grenade of middle-age horniness that occasionally detonates in aisle five at Spencer’s when I spot a woman buying Enfamil. I’m a gardenless, bald-testicled, post-liberal giant with walls for thoughts and dicks for dreams.

And when I hear a song now—any song of “resistance” or “solidarity” or “hope”—I feel nothing but the tremble of my own prostate, irritated as it is by sugar and spite.

There’s no chorus anymore.

Just feedback.

Just echoes bouncing off the piss-drenched walls we built ourselves.

I remember once, in school, they made us plant a tree for Van Mahotsav. I named mine “Comrade” because I was twelve and stupid and had just read *Che Guevara’s Motorcycle Diaries* between two bowel movements. I think that tree’s dead now. Died before I got pubes. Probably cut down to make room for a marble-floored parlour with a ten-foot statue of Ganesh and a fountain that smells like piss because everything eventually smells like piss in this fucking city.

And *we* are the giants now. Selfish, tired, shriveled, masturbating giants building walls around nothing worth protecting. We’ve got no children running in our gardens. Just dogs barking into the void and a YouTube algorithm playing us nationalist poetry over footage of tanks.

My phone buzzes.

Another message on the alumni group.

“Let’s plan a reunion?”

Yeah. Let’s meet and sing that fucking song again.

We shall overcome.

Someday.

After we’ve sucked every cock in front of us and every wall is covered in semen and shame and we’re all just lying flat on our backs trying not to fart too loud during the last note of the chorus.
