Bengalis eat birds. Yes. Yes, my friend. Birds. Not *bird food*. Not sunflower seeds and safflower dreams and millet melancholia. Not peck-peck vegetarianism with beaky restraint. No. We eat birds, actual flappity-flaps, winged poems, once tweeting now stewing.

Some cultures fly birds. Some cage them. Some revere them as messengers of God or metaphors in corporate PowerPoints. We marinate them in mustard, grind their bones into paste for *jhol*, and chew on cartilage with the same spiritual solemnity the Vatican reserves for wafers.

Because in Calcutta, the city where time ferments like leftover *ilish*, we eat birds with such enthusiasm it makes even the most carnivorous of colonials look like lactose-intolerant Quakers.

# The Poultry Hierarchy

Start with the humble chicken. *Gallus gallus domesticus*. Sanskrit for “seriously, again?” The British brought it and we turned it into "murgir jhol"—a bowl of poultry grief where dead chicken floats in turmeric regret, bobbing with potatoes that never stood a chance. Not to mention "rezala"—the Mughal orgasm of cashew-cumin soaked ghost flesh—where the bird has been slow-seduced in yogurt until its soul leaves via the fenugreek fumes.

Then comes the duck. *Haansh*. No, not “honk honk cute Donald” but a beast that’s been simmered till its fat bleeds history. We stew them in whole spices like we’re extracting confessions from an 18th-century traitor. One does not simply "cook" duck in Bengal. One holds it hostage over low heat with cinnamon threats and cardamom bribery.

Pigeon? *Parabotar jhol*. Absolutely. As if colonial trauma wasn’t enough, we added airborne rodents to our protein portfolio. Pigeons—those poo-artists of modern architecture—are rendered noble in a Bengali kitchen, dunked into pressure cookers of post-partition nostalgia and served with rice you never remember finishing.

Quail? You better believe it. The elusive *bater dim*—quail eggs—are considered aphrodisiacs, which is both hilarious and telling because nothing says “I want to bang you” like popping five miniature embryos with cumin salt and calling it foreplay.

# Wings of Desire

What’s with Bengalis and birds? Is it because we secretly want to fly but can’t get our sweet-loving asses off the ground? Is it because fish—our real spirit animal—got boring and bony and we wanted revenge on another branch of the animal kingdom? Or is it just that when we see feathers, we think “what would this taste like in mustard oil and existential crisis?”

Historically? Sure. [cite_start]Blame it on famine[cite: 75]. Blame it on partition. Blame it on rice inflation or ancestral trauma. Birds were plentiful, stupid, and fly into traps like ideas into WhatsApp forwards. And we, with our post-colonial passive-aggressive digestive systems, needed something to butter with guilt.

Etymologically? Even the words sound delicious. *Murgi*—which probably comes from Persian *murgh*, and before that possibly from some Proto-Indo-European root meaning “to die tastily”. *Haansh*—almost like a laugh, but wetter. *Bater dim*—a phrase that sounds like someone stubbing their toe on a rural egg.

# Chewing on the Past

But here’s the real kicker—this is not even about birds. It’s about Bengali identity. About consuming what once was free. About romanticizing rural poverty into urban Sunday brunch. About eating not just to live, but to re-live—the village, the partition, the train ride, the mother’s sigh, the grandfather’s cough, the tin roof, the aluminum plate, the red dot of chilli oil swirling in nostalgia.

Because we are not a people who merely digest. We remember. We ruminate. We chew on the past like gizzard, stubborn and rubbery. We eat birds because they are metaphors for everything that escaped.

And we cooked them.
