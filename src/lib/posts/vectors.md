I was always fascinated with vectors as a child, to be honest with anyone reading this, and that fascination is something I can finally express here when I am not extremely depressed. It will be less mathematical and more a common man's view of the vector, but of course, because both the common man and the mathematician use some language and symbols, I won't stray away from them. I will use LaTeX here, which makes it easy to type mathematical equations and such things in blog posts.

Again, I am not an expert, but I worked extensively as a machine learning engineer and a statistician in the US when AI was so unpopular that you were advised not to use words like "neural networks" or "AI" in your paper or your curriculum vitae. Of course, now the world has changed, but I want to tell the story that AI is still mostly just mathematics—in fact, a large part of it is vectors, or linear algebra. And so this is what many of these small posts will introduce.

It will take quite some time for me to organize my thoughts, write these posts, and create the visualizations that I think will help people understand the underlying issues of why we ascribe intelligence to machines when it is only mathematics under the hood, and why not understanding that—or understanding why this currently prevalent, at least apparently, superficially successful mathematics is different from the wet biological mathematics in animal brains—may lead to designing more explainable, deterministic synthetic intelligence that may one day be safely merged with our own brains.

Because I unwisely moved back to India and lost all my contacts and ways back to where any real work is being done, I can, at the very least, catch up on what is happening out there in the real world while I slowly rot and die in the proverbial frog's well. In any case, at my age, and given my mental disability, I am ill-suited for a fast life of pressured achievement, and I don't believe that artificial pressure—academic or industry—can make advances. The true advances happen in quiet moments when thinkers are not rushed, and that can happen anywhere.

Calcutta is, in fact, a wonderful place if you can cocoon yourself from the filthy air and water in a quiet environment in your own room, and that's what I do when I write these posts. I don't know if anyone will read them or not, but if they do, they'll be sharing the same thought space with me for a little while, and I am indebted for that.
