I was always fascinated with vectors as a child, to be honest with anyone reading this, and that fascination is something I can finally express here when I am not extremely depressed. It will be less mathematical and more a common man's view of the vector, but of course, because both the common man and the mathematician use some language and symbols, I won't stray away from them. I will use LaTeX here, which makes it easy to type mathematical equations and such things in blog posts.

Again, I am not an expert, but I worked extensively as a machine learning engineer and a statistician in the US when AI was so unpopular that you were advised not to use words like "neural networks" or "AI" in your paper or your curriculum vitae. Of course, now the world has changed, but I want to tell the story that AI is still mostly just mathematics—in fact, a large part of it is vectors, or linear algebra. And so this is what many of these small posts will introduce.

It will take quite some time for me to organize my thoughts and write these posts and create the visualizations that I think will help people understand the underlying issues of why we ascribe intelligence to machines when it is only mathematics under the hood, and why not understanding that—or understanding why that mathematics is different than the wet biological mathematics in animal brains—may lead to designing more synthetic intelligence that may one day be merged with our own brains.
