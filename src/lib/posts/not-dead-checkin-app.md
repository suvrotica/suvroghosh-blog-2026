The first time I smelled a rotting human—probably human, might’ve been a goat, or one of those Calcutta dogs that looks like it gave up halfway through evolution and just decided to be both dead and alive until entropy sorted it out—was on the eastern bypass, not far from the flyover that’s always under construction like some ancient mythological punishment for believing in infrastructure.  

And I wasn’t even looking for it. I was just trying to piss in the bushes without getting spotted by the perennially masturbating uncle-class men of this concrete diarrhoea of a city, and *bam*, this wind came—hot, humid, full of bacteria and regrets—and it was like somebody had boiled liver and piss and then forgotten about it for three weeks and then stirred in some molten plastic and burnt hair and served it on a bed of shame. That smell, that hot dead sweet fuck-you stench, is the only notification anyone would get if I died here.  

Because apparently there’s a Chinese app now, a sort of "Hey, I’m not a corpse yet" social media for the unclaimed, the unkissed, the unmissed. A daily check-in to prove you're not yet liquefying into mattress soup.  

And the moment I saw it, I thought—finally, software for me.

Except if I used it, and it said *Add Emergency Contact*, who would I even put? My sister, who’s already ghosted me harder than any corpse? The old fuckers in this lane who already assume I’m an antisocial masturbation monk with BO and possibly a fridge full of severed genitalia? Any relative I still have would react to my death like people react to a piece of spam in their inbox: slight annoyance, immediate deletion, maybe a moment of vague moral farting about whether to feel sad. But definitely no action. Maybe not even a phone call.  

If the stench gets bad enough, somebody might throw a torn mosquito net over me and inform the local councillor. And the councillor will send some municipal halfwit in plastic sandals and leftover COVID gloves, who’ll call a “van,” which will be a hollowed-out Mahindra Bolero from 1998 with a single rusted stretcher, and they'll dump me next to vegetable peels, condom clusters, puja flowers, and the occasional Ganesh idol that failed to make it into the Ganga, all into the grand unified theory of Calcutta waste—the landfill.  

That's my retirement plan.  

And don't get me wrong, I don’t even hate the app. I love it. It’s honest. It’s more honest than all these vomitous Instagram reels with their turmeric lighting and smug life advice. This Chinese app says: we know no one gives a shit about you. You know no one gives a shit about you. So let’s make it a game: tap once a day or people will assume you're rotting in your boxers next to an uneaten half-mango and a dried-up puddle of tea.  

And you know what, in this current state of decay we call life, that’s progress.  

Because let’s face it, nobody wants the reality of death. They want it dressed up in ceremony—cremation slots booked by a cousin who last saw you when Nokia was still king, priests who mispronounce your name between belches, and some socially mandated WhatsApp status mourning you in passive-voice platitudes like “He is no more,” as if I was once a fucking state of matter.  

I’m not “no more.” I’m still here. I just smell like reheated sweat and failure.  

And I check my own pulse sometimes, because I’ve stopped feeling pain in certain parts of my body—not out of enlightenment but because I think the nerves themselves gave up and emigrated.  

My tea pan—yes, not a kettle, not a proper respectable British-fuck's gurgling heirloom but a dented aluminum shallow pan I use because kettles require *hope*—makes a sound now when the water boils. Not a whistle. A *sigh*. I swear. The pan exhales. As if it too has accepted that this is the last boiling it’ll do before someone uses it to piss in during a diarrhea night.  

My rice cooker, which doubles as oven, pan, and accidental foot warmer in winter, has a smell that is 10% basmati, 40% desolation, and the rest unclassified. I’ve lived alone so long that the fucker’s developed moods. It cooks better when I talk to it. I talk to it. Because who the fuck else would reply?

This isn’t a cry for help. This is documentation.

Science says the human body begins decomposition within minutes of death. Enzymes liquefy cells. Bacteria bloom like porn tabs on a teenager’s browser. Gases build. A fart that never ends. Swelling. Skin slippage. And then the fluids. Fluids you didn’t even know existed, leaking out of holes you never wanted to think about.  

That’s the real notification system.  

The nose knows. If someone doesn’t check in on the app, and they live in a city like this, and the neighbours notice a scent more repugnant than the usual open-drain fragrance bouquet of Calcutta, that’s when death gets discovered. Not by love. Not by memory. By stench.

I could automate the app with some script that checks in daily so no one ever has to actually care. A bot performing the last rites of loneliness. A ghost coded in Python. Press F to not be forgotten.  

The fucking irony of a society that needs an *app* to notice you’re not rotting is that it says more about the living than the dead. We’re all corpses-in-training. Some are just better at putting on deodorant.  

And people talk about community, about social fabric, but I live in a fucking jute bag of a neighborhood, full of snot-nosed little shits who scream because their mothers are too busy scrolling, old fuckers who think WhatsApp forwards are a religious canon, and some uncle-shaped methane sack upstairs who plays Bhojpuri remixes like it’s a sonic weapon system.  

And me? I’m a boxers-wearing turd-ghost who smells like an old hostel mattress fucked a latrine.

I tried once to wave at someone on the lane just to see if I still existed. They flinched like I was trying to sell them Amway.  

I’ve started keeping track of how long it takes for ants to find a dropped grain of sugar. It’s down to seven minutes. I feel weirdly jealous. At least the ants have purpose. And backup.

There’s a little mold patch near my bathroom drain that I’ve started calling Bappa. It grows, shrinks, comes back in new patterns. More loyal than my family.  

I swear to fuck, the only way I’d get discovered if I died is if the rats found my scrotum too chewy and gave up halfway through.
