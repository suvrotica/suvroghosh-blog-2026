It begins with the smell, as all truly national tragedies must—the distinct double-whammy of temple cow diarrhea layered over a drain-choked gutter of half-fermented government idli—**a nose-fisting fog of fermented piss and cumin-tinted neglect** that wraps around your ankles like a nationalist uncle trying to bless your feet with turmeric and caste anxiety, while somewhere nearby, a man named Chintu is shitting behind a broken Ambedkar statue, his turds slow-cooked by the ambient 47°C heatwave and the vague hum of a nearby LED-lit Ram Mandir playing Bluetooth bhajans off a Chinese speaker made from parts stolen from a failed Chandrayaan lander.

No matter where you stand in this slum-tier Marvel Cinematic Universe of performative piety and panopticon populism, India—my mother, my matriarchal cunt of a country—has somehow managed to get herself spitroasted by the two most prolific dicks in our cultural arsenal: god and government. A **double penetration so gory, so moist, so spiritually prolapsed**, that even the Kamasutra would’ve tapped out and asked for a safe word. Which, in our case, is "secularism," but the safeword's been co-opted by upper-caste podcast hosts with expensive mics and zero shame.

And you know what the fuck of it is? I still live here. Still queue up for ration rice next to illiterate fuckwits who think WhatsApp forwards count as evidence in court. I still watch the same mustachioed morons with seven gold rings and saffron tilaks ramble about ancient science as if Rishi Vatsayana invented the WiFi before Newton figured out gravity by huffing a mango lassi and slipping on his own ejaculate.

I know the science. I know the fucking history. I know what British opium and Brahminical revisionism and the delightful flavor of bureaucratic shit-fuckery have done to this ancient termite mound of a nation. But my knowing doesn’t stop the priests from installing CCTV in my foreskin while the Home Ministry whispers that I'm the problem.

And I was born here. In a city that once produced Satyajit Ray and now vomits out YouTube astrologers who yell at Saturn as if it's an ex-girlfriend who left them on read. I grew up under fans that squeaked like rats fucking and studied under teachers whose greatest contribution to knowledge was not dying mid-lecture. I watched as democracy got sodomized, missionary-style, by a ruling party so proud of their erection they forgot they had to actually fuck the people, not just thrust at them from a podium. And meanwhile, the Opposition sits like a flaccid dick in a cold shower, trying to form a coalition while adjusting their silk lungis and checking for erectile dysfunction in their moral compass.

And let’s talk about the god bit. Oh, the god bit.

I’m an atheist, yes, but not the sexy Richard Dawkins kind, more like the bitter, bloated, Bengali-brand of book-bred disillusionment that comes from being raised in a household that feared poverty more than purgatory. I prayed once, I think—when I was ten and had a fever of 104—and my mother rubbed mustard oil on my chest while whispering mantras and Marxist slogans in the same breath. I recovered and took that as proof of hydration, not Hanuman.

But this country? It never stopped praying. It **prayed so hard it broke its own spine bending backwards to suck off every fucking deity in a ten-mile radius.** We pray to Shiva for stock tips, to Durga for beating our wives with divine license, to Sai Baba for washing away our paan-stained karma. And in the background, the real gods—those in khaki, those with guns and garlands and goddamn WhatsApp war rooms—build empires on the backs of the desperate and the dumb.

I went to vote last year. Had to walk past three drunk men pissing into a gutter that doubled as a ballot disposal site. Inside, I marked the EVM with the grace of a prostate exam. My choice was between two cocks: one wearing a saffron condom, the other one pretending not to be circumcised by capitalism.

Did it matter? No.

The EVM might as well have spat out a used condom with a QR code that redirected me to a news anchor yelling **“Hindutva is development, development is Hindutva”** while his mouth foamed like an epileptic goat being tasered at a Bajrang Dal rally.

My neighbor’s kid, sweet kid, plays PUBG all day and thinks Chandragupta Maurya is a PUBG skin. His mom sells Ganga water in recycled mineral bottles and believes her smartphone gave her COVID. Meanwhile, I sit in my one-bedroom concrete prison built on land that was probably stolen from a Dalit family during the Emergency, eating microwave dal and wondering if my dead father was right when he said the real sin wasn’t disbelief—it was participating in a system you know is broken just to avoid being lonely.

My sin is participation.

My sin is not leaving.

My sin is still giving a fuck.

I read a physics paper last night—about entropic horizons in de Sitter space, but it might as well have been a suicide note written by a dying sun. Because entropy is real. Decay is real. Not just in the universe, but in the veins of this country. I can smell it in the sweat of metro guards, in the diesel farts of rickshaws, in the stifled moans of underpaid data entry clerks who still say “sir” to men who ejaculate Sanskrit and smell like burnt democracy.

And you know what else? I’ve stopped trying to shit in the mornings. My bowels are clogged with ideology. My colon is a battleground of suppressed rage, leftover beef, and Dolo 650 tablets crushed into resignation.

Every morning, I sit, shirtless, like a balding Vishnu, on my porcelain throne, hoping for release—not just fecal, but existential—and all I get is gas, and the faint echo of a man chanting “Jai Shri Ram” down the lane as if constipation can be cured by slogans.

It can't.

Nor can this fucked-up, rectal wart of a nation.

I love her.

I hate her.

And I can’t stop smelling her burnt hair and urine-drenched dreams.

If this was a film, it’d end with a triumphant flute solo and a drone shot over the Himalayas. But this is real. This is now. This is me trying to unclog my sink with a rubber plunger that smells like wet nationalism and failed engineering entrance exams.

The last time I got hard was during a BBC documentary about termite queens.
I came three seconds after the narrator said “pheromone symphony.”
Then I wiped myself with a handout from the Election Commission.
