# Delhi AQI

I am watching Gul Saxena on YouTube not because she’s Lata Mangeshkar (though she sings well), but because she’s an eerily close look-alike of my ex-wife—who, the last time I can hold her face still in memory, looked like a young Runa Laila.

That memory is pinned to Delhi, to our honeymoon in 2001: a city that felt like a step up from Calcutta—cleaner angles, wider roads, a slightly more confident electricity—though still nowhere near the league of American cities like Austin, where I was living then and where even the blandness had an odd competence to it.

Now I’m a divorced, fifty-year-old, crusty scrote, and I can’t tell whether it’s the AQI inside my head or the one outside that’s the real problem. The first thing I notice—before thought, before politics, before the day has put on its trousers and started lying to itself—is the taste.

It arrives the way bad news does in India: politely, persistently, and already inside your mouth.

I’m on my little South Calcutta fringe, the unfashionable outskirts where the city ends not with a grand boulevard but with a tired shrug, and the morning air, which used to be a kind of invisible mercy, has acquired texture. Not *weather*, exactly. More like an unasked-for condiment. You can almost chew it. The tea—my one stable relationship—goes from aromatic to metallic if I leave the window open, as if the leaves have begun to remember they were once dust themselves.

Some video says Delhi’s AQI is 402 today. I ask in the comments if it isn’t 420, because of course I do as a responsible Bengali smartass fuckface, because we are a nation that loves numbers the way a child loves firecrackers: loud, meaningless, and vaguely patriotic. 420, the little numeric wink—*charso bees*—the folk code for “cheat,” that sweet Indian invention where the crime is always individual and never structural, as if corruption were a personality trait and not a climate.

I hear myself replying—Are you sure it’s not 420?—and immediately I want to slap myself, because even my sarcasm has become a coping mechanism with air holes. Still, the joke works the way jokes work in a sinking boat: it doesn’t stop the water, but it gives everyone something to do with their hands besides panic.

AQI is a funny acronym. It sounds like a new private engineering college—“A.Q.I. Institute of Advanced Excellence”—where the brochure is glossy, the lab equipment is imaginary, and the placement officer is a cousin. And yet, the concept behind it is almost heartbreakingly simple: take a mess of pollutants—PM2.5, PM10, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide—squash the chaos into a single index, and tell people, in a childproof number, how poisoned their lungs are today. A domesticated apocalypse, alphabetized and converted into a score you can scroll past while buying discounted socks.

My brain, in its tiresome science-and-math brained way, keeps wanting to translate: PM2.5 is particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers, fine enough to sneak past the body’s bouncers—nose hairs, mucus, those pathetic little defenses we pretend are modern infrastructure—and lodge deep in the lungs, sometimes wandering further like an uninvited relative who discovers the guest room and decides to stay. A micrometer is one-millionth of a meter, which is a wonderfully crisp fact until you remember that “one-millionth” is exactly the scale at which our political accountability also operates.

There’s a folk etymology I once heard (and immediately distrusted, which is my only real talent): that “smog” comes from *smoke* plus the Hindi *maug* or *mog* or some other invented syllable allegedly meaning “fog.” This is nonsense, of course; “smog” is just smoke + fog, a portmanteau coined in early 20th century England, the kind of neat little linguistic mash-up that suggests the problem was once quaint enough to name with wordplay. We love these fake derivations because they flatter us: if the word is ours, the phenomenon is ours, which means we own it, which means we can transcend it by chanting something about ancient wisdom. Meanwhile, the actual particles are busy doing chemistry in your alveoli.

I think of my childhood in North Calcutta, when “pollution” meant two-stroke scooters coughing blue ghosts, and the solution was to wave your hand theatrically in front of your face like a Bengali auntie shooing a fly. The air was bad then too, but it was still, in a crude way, *legible*. You could point to the culprit. You could scold it. You could blame a bus. Now the danger has become statistical, diffuse, everywhere, the perfect Indian form: no single villain, only a thousand “small” exceptions adding up to a national condition. The street vendor burns plastic because the municipal bin is missing; the bin is missing because the contractor is absent; the contractor is absent because the tender was a ritual offering to a politician’s nephew; the politician’s nephew is a patriot on television.

The number 402 (or 420, if we’re doing numerology for cynics) is not just a measurement. It’s a mirror held up to a society that has learned to live with slow violence the way we live with potholes: adjust your gait, blame your luck, move on.

And the laity—what a lovely word, laity, like lace—are anesthetized, complicit, victims, accomplices, the whole contradictory circus. I include myself, obviously. I’m sitting here, lecturing into the void, using my vocabulary like a mask, as if a good sentence can filter PM2.5. *Dekho, dekho,* the educated man says, while ordering takeout in plastic.

Nationalism, in this context, becomes a kind of respiratory hallucination. “Indian supremacy” (the phrase itself wheezes) requires a certain kind of air: not the oxygen kind, the narrative kind. It needs the haze of myth, the thick fog of “we were vishwaguru,” the comforting exhaust of ancient greatness pumped into the present to keep the engine of self-regard running. When the literal air becomes unbreathable, the metaphorical air gets even thicker—because people who are suffocating do not want to be told they are suffocating; they want to be told they are heroic divers in a sacred ocean.

There’s a grim comedy here that even Mencken would have enjoyed, if he weren’t busy coughing: the more measurable the disaster becomes, the more mystical the response. Numbers should sober us. Instead they become talismans. 200, 300, 400—like cricket scores. Like marks in an exam. Like GDP targets. Like the number of years our civilization allegedly predates everyone else’s. We are addicts of magnitude.

# In 5 years... 

Give it five more years, you say, and there’ll be haze inside your house and you won’t be able to see your pisser when pissing.

This is grotesque, yes, but it’s also the kind of domestic prophecy that hits harder than any policy paper because it drags the abstract down to the humiliating human level where all truth lives: the bathroom, the throat, the eyes that sting, the child who coughs at night and is told it’s “just allergy,” as if the air itself were a seasonal flower. The body doesn’t care about ideology. The lungs are famously non-partisan. They are equal-opportunity sufferers—though the poor, as usual, get more of the “opportunity.”

In my more manic moments—those little bursts of mental overclocking where everything connects too neatly—I imagine the future Indian home as a terrarium. Sealed windows, humming purifiers, a family sitting inside like rare orchids, scrolling reels about “proud heritage,” while outside the city conducts its daily sacrifice of diesel, dust, crop-burning residue, construction grit, and the sacred smoke of garbage fires. The child asks why the purifier is always on. The parent says, because we are modern. Nobody says, because the world outside has become a slow gas chamber and we’re pretending it’s progress.

Then the depressive clarity arrives, quiet and absolute: we have always done this. Not the purifier part—the denial part. We normalize what should revolt us. We live inside emergencies until they become furniture. We develop a genius for adaptation that is indistinguishable from surrender.

Somewhere in the middle, hope does its shy little Bengali thing—turns up late, doesn’t speak much, sits at the back with its hands folded. It whispers: this is not fate. This is not karma. This is not a cosmic test of national character. This is combustion, regulation failure, incentives, enforcement, urban planning, energy choices, agricultural practice, and the political economy of pretending everything is fine.

Which means, annoyingly, it can be changed.

Not by slogans, obviously. Slogans are air fresheners sprayed in a burning room. Changed by the unglamorous machinery of adulthood: standards that are enforced, transport that works, power that isn’t a coal-fed prayer, waste that isn’t set on fire like a ritual, farmers who aren’t forced into practices that make the sky cough, cities that stop treating construction dust as a natural element like wind or time.

And yet—*and yet*—I know what we will do first. We will argue about the number. We will debate 402 versus 420. We will make memes. We will accuse someone of defaming the nation. We will demand that the air apologize for being anti-national.

I close the window. The room smells briefly of old paper and tea leaves and my own stubborn carbon-based existence. Outside, the city continues, busy being itself. The light has that dull, filtered quality—like sunlight seen through a used handkerchief—and for a second the world looks almost cinematic, almost beautiful, the way disasters often do when they’re far enough away from the part of you that has to breathe.
