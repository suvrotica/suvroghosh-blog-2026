There is a specific genre of cough that sounds less like a human ailment and more like a lawnmower trying to start inside a library, and that cough is me. Every single winter. I am currently situated on a mattress that has seen better decades, surrounded by a fortress of lozenge wrappers and a cup of ginger tea that tastes aggressively medicinal, hacking up what I can only assume are chunks of colonial regret. I have essentially become a biological humidity problem.

And let me be clear about the AQI—the Air Quality Index, or *Awful Quality Indicator*, depending on how long you’ve been marinating in this haze. It isn’t just bad in Delhi, the smog-capital of the north, where politicians wear masks less for safety and more so you can’t read their lips. No, it is just as dispiriting in every other city you might foolishly flee to for relief. Bangalore? Please. The optimistic tech workers there seem to think that standing in gridlock traffic while coughing politely into a handkerchief counts as "climate resilience."

And Calcutta—ah, my beloved city of sweets and skepticism—is right there in the running. The fog here isn’t fog; it’s *air dandruff*. It is a suspension of diesel, dust, and history. You walk out in the morning and the air smells like a chemistry set that gave up on life. It’s not even breathable—it’s chewable. I took a deep breath yesterday and I swear it tasted like wet concrete and bad decisions.

The “safe” level, according to whichever bureaucrat decided to put arbitrary numbers on a chart, is 50. We are currently sitting at 297. That is not air. That is a soup that happens to be gaseous. That is the atmosphere actively trying to bully your bronchial tubes.

Let’s talk about the *bugs*, shall we? You would think that in a country with this many deities, we would at least have the courtesy to catch a normal cold. But no. The Indian breeze now carries strains of bacteria that look at penicillin the way a teenager looks at a curfew. You sniff, and the bug inside you looks up at the antibiotic you’re bravely swallowing and mutters, “Is that it? Is that all you have?” Then it calls its friends. These are multidrug-resistant, over-achieving cousins. You are basically breathing in a *Munna Bhai M.B.B.S.* remix of super-viruses.

These aren’t seasonal sniffles. This isn’t the quaint "winter blues." This is a full-scale siege of mucus. This is your body trying to sneeze out seventy-five years of urban planning failures.

And you can’t escape it. You think, "I’ll go to the outskirts," right? You think, "Maybe outside the metro center, near the trees, the air is crisp?" You naive soul. The suburbs are worse. They burn garbage there with a level of dedication usually reserved for religious rituals. Plastic, tires, old mattresses—they set it on fire and call it "winter heating." You step outside and it smells like a bonfire made entirely of synthetic fabrics. The air is visible. You breathe in and you can actually *feel* the particulate matter settling into your lungs and signing a long-term lease.

And we don’t even care. That is the genius of this place: after decades of exposure to everything from lead paint to diesel fumes, we’ve adapted by simply *denying reality*. You’re coughing continuously? “It’s just the change in weather.” Your eyes are watering? “Dust is everywhere.” Your existence feels like a smog alert? “Have some turmeric milk.”

Science? Ha. The last time someone tried to explain particulate matter to me, it was a gentleman with a literal pigeon on his shoulder who insisted, “These numbers are a hoax. It is just a way to sell air purifiers.” Yes, Subhash. The global elite invented asthma just so they could sell you a plastic fan.

And don’t even get me started on the masks. The same people who will wear a wool monkey cap in 46°C heat because of "tradition" will absolutely refuse to wear an N95 because of "personal liberty." Forget your liberty; your liberty smells like exhaust fumes and burning rubber.

Let’s go deeper. Into the lungs. The cilia in your airways—those delicate little bristles whose job it is to sweep out the dust like microscopic janitors—have simply given up. They have unionized. They have looked at the incoming air and said, “We aren’t paid enough for this.” Mucus production is up. Oxygen absorption is down. You become a human humidifier that wheezes like a vintage car—rumbly, unreliable, and always threatening to stall.

Meanwhile, the children are out playing football in this aerosol soup, and you wonder why the eight-year-old has a cough that sounds like an eighty-year-old coal miner.

But we still have our festivals. Oh yes. What better way to celebrate the gift of life than by detonating a small arsenal of sulfur in a crowded neighborhood? Nothing screams "spiritual joy" quite like sending a cloud of gunpowder smoke into the bedroom of your elderly neighbor. Diwali, weddings, a Tuesday—it’s always time to light something on fire and force the entire block to participate in your respiratory distress.

Let me be clear: there is no clean corner left. You go to Hyderabad, you think, “Tech hub, surely the air smells like fresh circuitry?” No, it smells like burnt curry leaves and traffic. Chennai? Mosquito fogging. Every morning. I saw a child disappear into a cloud of DDT and emerge ten minutes later looking confused and slightly greasier.

I haven’t felt a genuine burst of energy since the AQI hit 400. I don’t know if it’s the pollution or the despair, but every time I try to do something rigorous, like walk up a flight of stairs, I run out of breath halfway up and have to sit down with my inhaler like a Victorian ghost. Try explaining that to your neighbor when she hears you wheezing on the landing. “No, Aunty, I’m fine, I was just trying to get oxygen to my brain.”

It’s the air. It’s *in* the air. It *is* the air. There is no escape. The country is a slow cooker and we are the stew.

And the best part? The weather report still describes the air quality as “moderate.” Moderate.

Anyway, I’m going to go microwave a stale dumpling and watch the AQI needle twitch like a nervous squirrel.

If I succumb to the smog tonight, tell them to cremate me somewhere far away so I don’t add to the particulate count in my own neighborhood.

And please, wear a mask.
