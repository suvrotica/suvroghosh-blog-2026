There is a kind of cough that sounds like a chain-smoking goat got mouth-fucked by a diesel generator, and that cough is me, every fucking winter, sitting on my crusty shit-brown mattress with an old sock full of phlegm-colored lozenges and a cup of lukewarm ginger-piss tea, hacking up chunks of colonial regret and airborne streptococcal rebellion. I am essentially a biological sputum factory now.

And let me tell you, the AQI—or Air Quality Index, or *Arsehole Quantification Indicator*, depending on how long you’ve been breathing this diseased fart haze—is not just bad in Delhi, the fart-throne of the north, where the politicians wear masks not for health but because their own breath would incriminate them, no, it's just as dick-punching horrible in every other city you’d stupidly think might offer relief. Bangalore? Shove a eucalyptus leaf up your fucking urethra, the IT cunts there still think standing in traffic next to a chai stall coughing politely into their elbows counts as climate resilience.

And Calcutta—ah, my beloved rice-and-roach city, where the roads are paved with broken glass and broken promises—isn’t far behind in this coughing competition. The fog here isn’t fog, it’s *air dandruff*. Diesel, dust, and dead bacteria doing a conga line up your nostrils. You walk out in the morning and it smells like a tuberculosis patient farted into a car exhaust. It’s not even breathable—it’s chewable. I bit into a fucking lungful of air yesterday and I swear it tasted like hot concrete seasoned with pestilence.

The “safe” level, according to whichever fuckstick bureaucrat licked a foreign report and slapped some numbers on the wall, is 50. We are at 297. That’s not air. That’s a war crime with a fucking pollen count. That’s mustard gas’s autistic cousin with a fondness for schoolchildren’s bronchioles.

Let’s talk about *resistant bugs*, shall we? You’d think in a country with 300 gods and not one working toilet, we’d at least have the courtesy to die quickly from our plagues. But no. Indian air is now a pan-continental orgasm of microbial resistance. The very *wind* carries strains of bacteria that make penicillin curl up like a flaccid dick in winter. You sniff, and the bug inside you looks up at the amoxicillin tab you’re bravely swallowing and mutters, “That all you got, pussy?” Then calls its cousins. Multidrug-resistant, carbapenem-resistant, MDR-TB-bearing cousins. You are basically breathing in a fucking MUNNA BHAI M.B.B.S. remix of Superbugs.

These aren’t seasonal sniffles, okay? This isn’t your white person’s idea of winter blues. This is a chest-fucking, rib-kicking siege of mucus and wheeze and paracetamol shits. This is your body trying to sneeze out 75 years of national policy failure through a snot rocket.

And you can’t escape. You go to the “boondocks”, right? Think: “Ah, maybe outside the metro center, out where there’s a little greenery, maybe some fresh air?” You fucknut. The suburbs are worse. They burn garbage there like it’s tantric. Plastic, tyre, hair, ancestral regret—they’ll set it on fire and call it “keeping warm.” You step outside and it smells like a funeral pyre fucked a chemical factory. The air is *visible*, like a ghost made of burnt condom smoke. You breathe and you *feel* the PM2.5 enter your lungs and scribble *I OWN THIS HOUSE NOW* on your alveoli.

And we don’t even *care*. Because here’s the genius of this place: after decades of chronic exposure to everything from lead to diesel adulterated with rat semen, we’ve culturally adapted by *denying everything*. You cough blood? “Must be the season.” Your eyes burn? “Pollution is everywhere.” Your piss smells like a smog alert? “You should try ayurveda.” You dumb twat.

Science? Ha. The last time someone explained particulate matter to me, it was a guy with a literal pigeon on his shoulder saying, “These things are hoaxes. Just population control by the white men.” Yes, Subhash. The Rothschilds personally invented asthma so they could sell you inhalers in exchange for your chappals.

And don’t even start with masks. The same people who wear skull caps in 46°C heat because “tradition” won’t wear a PM2.5-filtered N95 because “freedom.” Fuck your freedom. Your freedom smells like lung butter and rat corpse.

Let’s go deeper. Literally. Into the lungs. The cilia in your airways, those delicate little bristle-fucks that sweep out invaders like microscopic janitors on cocaine, have given up. They’ve unionized and declared: “We’re done, boss.” Mucus production up. Oxygen absorption down. You’re a human humidifier that breathes like a 1990s Ambassador car—rough, loud, and always on the verge of breakdown.

Meanwhile, the kids are out playing football in this soup of aerosols, bacteria, and industrial off-gassing, and you’re wondering why the eight-year-old has a cough that sounds like your 80-year-old uncle with tuberculosis and shame.

But we still have festivals. Oh yes. What better way to celebrate the breath of life than by blowing up a fucking arsenal of sulphur and nitrate in the middle of a crowded slum? Nothing screams “spiritual elevation” like sending 200 decibels of gunpowder into the lungs of your elderly neighbor. Diwali, Chhath Puja, some bastard’s birthday—it’s always time to fire something up and tell your neighbor’s lungs to suck your incense-stick dick.

Let me be clear: there is *no* clean corner left. You go to Hyderabad, you think, “Tech bros, maybe their air smells like MacBook farts.” No, it smells like burning curry leaves and crushed dreams. Chennai? Mosquito fogging. Every morning. I saw a child disappear into a cloud of DDT and come out ten minutes later with a limp and a stutter.

I haven’t had a proper erection since the AQI hit 400. I don’t know if it’s the pollution or the despair or the fact that every time I try to jerk off, I run out of breath halfway through and have to sit down with my salbutamol inhaler like a wheezing pervert. Try explaining that to your upstairs neighbor when she hears you panting and slapping flesh at 2 AM. “No aunty, I was just trying to air out my soul through my dickhole.”

It’s the air. It’s *in* the air. It’s *on* the air. It *is* the air. There is no escape. The country is a slow cooker and your lungs are the meat.

And the best part? The weather reports still say “moderate.” Moderate, my farting asshole.

Anyway, I’m going to go microwave a stale momo and watch the AQI needle twitch like a coked-up squirrel.

If I die tonight, tell them to burn my body somewhere far away so it doesn’t add to the fucking PM10 in my neighborhood.

And don’t forget to wear a fucking mask, you freedom-huffing twat.
