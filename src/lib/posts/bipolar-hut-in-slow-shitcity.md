It begins with the sound of my own piss ricocheting off the rusted inner wall of the aluminum bucket I use because the goddamn flush doesn’t work, hasn’t worked in months, and every plumber I call looks at me with that Kolkata-smirk of condescension mixed with faint horror—because I’m a lone, angry, brown middle-aged fart-snorting man who speaks too precisely and always sounds like he’s going to punch someone for using the word “chakna”—and they disappear after the first inspection, probably assuming I molest cats or hoard biscuits or collect the fingernails of electricians.

Anyway.

That piss—let’s not forget it, that symphony of yellow urgency and reluctant dribble—is the *only* sound I have full control over most days.

There’s this rhythm to it now. Wake up. Wonder who I am. Drink the tap water that tastes faintly like metallic goat farts and arsenic-soaked chalk. Sit on the bucket like an emperor of decay. Eat stale peanuts. Try not to scream at the trees. Avoid WhatsApp. Whisper to the tea pan. And somewhere, if I’ve taken the fucking meds, sleep again. 

I do not say this for pity.

I say it because I am still alive, and that is not fucking nothing.

Let me clarify, for the cocksuckers in the back: *bipolar medications are a form of biochemical rape.* Yes, that’s right, wrap your little TED-Talk brains around that. They assault the sovereign bastard who is *you*, and not in a sexy way. Not in a “take me you lithium daddy” way. No. They go into your skull like a colonizer, stake flags in your serotonin valleys, piss on your dopamine lakes, and build mind-dams where there used to be waterfalls of fantasy, rage, sexual hallucination, and strange euphoria that made sense only to trees and broken photocopiers. They level your interior like a bad mall. 

And before you say, “But they save lives!”—yes, of course they do. They *save* you the same way a padded cell does. They don’t fix a goddamn thing. They just keep you from jumping off balconies or punching your reflection during the fourth sleepless night of talking to your own thoughts with the hunger of a junkie philosopher. 

I’m telling you, slow helps.

This slow shithole of a city, this nowhere Calcutta suburb where buses fart old diesel onto goats and air conditioners cry milky tears of iron oxide onto old women’s umbrellas—this *slowness* is medicinal. It’s the best sedative I’ve ever known. You want to *stay alive* with bipolar disorder? Move somewhere where *nothing* happens. Ever. No stimulation. No temptation. No dicks to suck and no pussies to chase and no project deadlines or festivals or women with jasmine in their hair asking you to dance. 

Just… cow dung, municipal silence, bad signal, dust, and one uncle with undiagnosed neurosyphilis yelling about Modi while squatting beside a dead cat.

My nervous system fucking thanks me. 

Let me explain with fake science.

Imagine your brain is a tub of sour yogurt with a pissed-off fly in it. That’s untreated bipolar. Now imagine some Swedish shrink decides the solution is to *freeze* the whole goddamn tub until the fly just becomes a vague protein smear. That’s meds. But here’s where this gutter of a city helps—it doesn’t freeze you, it just... evaporates urgency. Like a drunk ex removing herself from the party. It bores you out of mania. It delays psychosis. It stretches your panic into boredom until the scream becomes a nap.

I used to dream of cities with speed and chrome and infinite coffee shops and baristas with septum rings who'd quote Camus while handing you your oatmilk cappuccino. 

Now I wake up next to a gecko with three toes and a fungus-covered light switch. 

And I’m safer here.

You wouldn’t understand unless your neurons have tried to fucking *murder you* from the inside, unless you’ve shat while crying from joy and dread *at the same time*, unless you’ve sent 142 messages to a friend who no longer exists and then apologized to a traffic light. 

The brain is a cunt. 

No. Strike that. The *mind* is the cunt. The brain is just the meat radio, the grey shrimp with spark plugs. The *mind*, though—that bastard is the bad roommate who throws piss bottles at your guests and accuses you of microaggressions while masturbating to old Doordarshan weather reports. 

Sometimes I think the only sane thing to do is give it no audience.

Feed it oats, deny it spectacle, remove caffeine, embrace cabbage. Listen to ceiling fans like they’re philosophers. Sleep next to electrical wires because the faint hum is better than poetry. 

Slowness, my love, my whore, my sponge bath from God.

I haven’t had a proper erection in months. Not one that didn’t feel either chemically forced or emotionally fraudulent. But I’ll take that over mania. I’ll take this flaccid peace over the carnivorous joy of grandiosity, because grandiosity eats you from the top down. You go from “maybe I’ll write a poem” to “maybe I’ll convert to Jainism and start a traveling sex cult for narcoleptics” in three nights and one extra Bournvita overdose. 

Fuck the glamour. 

You think Van Gogh was glamorous? He stank like ass, cut his ear off, and bled alone while hallucinating Christ in a bowl of absinthe. Sylvia Plath’s oven. Cobain’s shotgun. Robin Williams hanging like a broken piñata of joy. *We don’t survive brilliance. We survive boredom.*

And that’s why I live here. In this broken shanty with barely 300 square feet of cracked cement, boxers that haven’t seen detergent since Diwali, one rice cooker, one pan, one cracked mirror that makes my face look like a Picasso farted, and one weak WiFi router that blinks like a dying firefly with erectile dysfunction. 

I could move. I could work again. I could chase the dreams. 

But I don’t trust dreams.

Dreams are manic erections in the pants of fate.

Dreams got me institutionalized.

Dreams make me walk seven kilometers at midnight believing I’m the reincarnation of Ramanujan with a mission to decipher the piss trails of stray dogs as sacred geometric codes.

No.

Now I dream of sleep.

I dream of pooping on time. Of tea that doesn’t taste like rust and cigarette ash. Of neighbors who don’t bang like methed-up goats every Thursday night. Of not seeing Jesus in the water stains.

I dream of decibels staying low, and dopamine staying polite.

Because the only thing more dangerous than *being* bipolar is *remembering* who you were during the high. 

That motherfucker was beautiful.

And I don’t miss him.

But sometimes, on Wednesday mornings when the street dogs don’t bark and the sky looks like undercooked mutton, I feel him twitch. Like a fart waiting to bloom.

And I remember he had better posture.
