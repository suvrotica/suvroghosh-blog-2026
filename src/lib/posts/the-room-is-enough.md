The fan is doing its usual North-Indian-December imitation of a bored bureaucrat: technically present, spiritually absent. The room is the size of a small argument. One cot that creaks like an old man’s knees, one table that has survived tea spills, pen leaks, and the occasional fist (mine; always mine; I have never once punched the world, only the furniture that couldn’t run away). The walls are that municipal off-white that looks like it was invented to lower ambition. Somewhere outside, a scooter coughs itself into the evening, and the air carries that familiar Kolkata perfume—diesel, damp, frying oil, and a hint of somebody’s incense trying to bribe reality into being less filthy.

This room is enough.

That sentence looks like a fortune cookie if you stare at it too long, but right now it lands like a stone at the bottom of a bucket: *thunk*, and the mind goes quiet for half a second because it has to acknowledge the weight. Enough. Not “great,” not “glorious,” not “thriving,” not “winning” (what a repulsive verb we have made of life), just enough. The kind of enough you can afford when your bank balance and your mood both behave like faulty electrical switches—on for a moment, off for a week, sparking, unreliable, smelling faintly of burnt plastic.

The moment is enough. I do not need to be anywhere else.

I say it and immediately a sly part of me sneers: *What are you, a monk now? A minimalist influencer in a lungi?* And another part of me—older, tired, not impressed by the cleverness of my own cynicism—answers: no, idiot, I’m trying not to be eaten alive by my own nervous system.

Because that’s what stress is, stripped of the motivational TED-talk varnish. Stress is not “pressure.” Stress is not “challenge.” Stress is a primate’s internal alarm bell screaming *tiger, tiger, tiger* while the tiger is actually a WhatsApp message, a relative’s tone, a stranger’s casual disrespect, a landlord’s hint, a job posting that wants “young dynamic rockstar,” which is capitalism’s way of saying, please die quietly.

My body does not understand modernity. My body understands teeth, claws, exile, shame. The HPA axis—hypothalamus, pituitary, adrenal, a bureaucratic triangle inside the skull—doesn’t care that the danger is “only psychological.” Cortisol comes anyway, like an uninvited guest who eats your snacks and then lectures you about discipline.

So I built a ritual, not because I’m noble, but because I’m lazy in the strategic sense: I want the cheapest intervention that prevents the whole system from flipping into full melodrama.

**Go back to your room, close the door.**

That’s step one. A door is a technology. One of humanity’s finest, up there with fire and exaggeration. You close it and the world becomes slightly less loud, slightly less entitled to your attention. The storms can rage outside. The ceiling fan can pretend to help. Your room becomes a boundary condition—like in physics, where you solve the messy differential equation only after you decide what the edges are allowed to do. Without boundary conditions everything diverges into infinity, which is exactly what my thoughts like to do at 2:17 a.m.

**Two minutes: feet-on-floor + slow exhale.**

This sounds like wellness pamphlet nonsense until you do it in anger. Feet on the floor is not poetry, it is wiring. It tells the body, *we have ground, we have friction, we are not falling.* Slow exhale is a cheat code, because exhale is the part of breathing that you can stretch like taffy; inhale you can’t bully without getting lightheaded and stupid. Exhale tells the vagus nerve—hello, yes, the long wandering nerve that’s basically your body’s emotional telephone cable—that you are not being chased. If you do it long enough, you can feel the internal weather shift from cyclone to drizzle.

**Five minutes: write a messy, uncensored brain-dump in a cheap notebook.**

Not noble. Not philosophical. Not “dear diary, today I learned.” No. Vomit it onto the page.

“Met X. Hate this. This made me angry because…”

And the “because” is the key, the little crowbar. Because the mind loves to cosplay as pure reason, but it’s mostly a bag of grievances in a trench coat. You write “because” and suddenly you are forced to name the actual wound: disrespect, fear, humiliation, loneliness, envy. Ugly little gods. You drag them into the light and they shrink a bit, like cockroaches that can’t do their best work when the tube light is on.

**Then: do one body thing—stretch, few slow squats, walk the corridor once—before you sit or lie down.**

Because sitting is how depression wins. Sitting is how my life has quietly evaporated, pixel by pixel, into screens and spirals and a dull ache that pretends to be “personality.” Movement is not redemption; it’s simply refusal. I am not obliged to stand in the rain. I may step inside. People can be storms. I have lived among storms. I have been a storm.

And it is strange, isn’t it, how quickly this becomes metaphysics.

# Enough, as a concept humans keep rediscovering and then promptly forgetting

Etymology is my favorite form of time travel because it lets you watch words evolve the way you watch a city rot—slowly, sensibly, with occasional bursts of absurdity. “Enough” in English has that sturdy Anglo-Saxon bluntness, the kind of word you can imagine being spoken near a fire by someone who had never heard of a stock market. It points to sufficiency, to a stopping point. Latin gives you *satis*—satisfied, satiated, stuffed; the body enters the language like a belly entering a room. In Sanskrit you get a whole moral universe around adequacy and excess and the constant teasing desire called *tृष्णा* (*tṛṣṇā*), thirst, which doesn’t mean “I would like water,” it means “I will die if I don’t get more,” even if the “more” is just another hit of validation.

The old texts knew thirst. Of course they did. Humans have not changed; we’ve just improved the delivery systems.

Rigveda, the ancient generator of hymns and cosmic gossip, has a line I like because it’s so disarmingly sane for something so old: “आ नो भद्राः क्रतवो यन्तु विश्वतः”—*ā no bhadrāḥ kratavo yantu viśvataḥ*—let good thoughts come to us from all directions. It’s not a dominance chant. It’s not “we were the greatest.” It’s basically: please, universe, send me ideas that don’t destroy me.

And then we arrived in 2025 Kolkata where “good thoughts” mostly arrive in the form of targeted ads for things I cannot buy, plus the occasional ideological uncle forwarding a video about ancient aircraft and cosmic lasers, as if embarrassment itself isn’t already one of India’s major exports.

The phrase “my room is enough” is, at one level, trivial—like saying “my plate is enough” or “this cup of tea is enough,” which is something my grandmother might have said while refusing a second helping with the dignity of someone who has seen real hunger and does not romanticize it.

But at another level it’s a rebellion against the modern demand that you should be everywhere, should be optimizing, should be networking, should be “leveraging synergies,” should be turning your very existence into a project plan with milestones and a pitch deck. The world has turned the human soul into a start-up. My soul is not venture-backed. My soul is not even properly audited.

# The storm problem

“People can be storms; I am not obliged to stand in the rain.”

I love that line because it refuses the usual moral blackmail. We’ve been trained—especially in our sticky Indian family systems—to treat exposure to other people’s dysfunction as a duty. As if enduring someone’s emotional hailstorm makes you virtuous, as if boundaries are a Western luxury product sold in fancy therapy clinics.

But storms don’t become holy because they have a human face.

Some people weaponize chaos. Some people are just chaotic. Often the difference is so subtle that it becomes a philosophical argument, like the one you have with yourself after a fight: *Was he cruel or merely stupid? Was she manipulative or merely frightened?* I’ve been on both sides. I have spoken with surgical precision in anger and then pretended it was “just honesty,” which is the oldest lie in the book of the self.

My bipolar mind, when it tilts up, becomes a factory that manufactures connections at industrial speed. Everything links to everything: the smell of kerosene links to childhood, childhood links to colonial education, colonial education links to my English-medium school in North Calcutta between 1984 and 1992, where we learned to speak in the accents of power while living among broken pavements and waterlogged lanes; then St. Xavier’s (1992–1994), the teenage years where ego arrives like acne; then Jadavpur University (1994–1998), where intelligence is abundant but money is not, and everyone learns to pretend they don’t care about status while secretly caring like their life depends on it; then UTSA in San Antonio (1998–2000), where my brain discovered that America is not a movie, it is a machine; then a startup job around 2000–2002 where optimism is sold in sprints; then UTHSCSA and the VA (2002–2014), years of being useful in a narrow technical sense while the rest of me drifted like sediment; then 2014, returning to India with that delusional immigrant reverse-hero narrative—*I will come back and build something*—and watching the Hyderabad startup fail in the way most things fail here: not with drama but with paperwork, delays, and the slow suffocation of enthusiasm.

And then nothing clicked since then. Not in the grand way. Not in the “I found my mission” way. The future, as a concept, went from being a corridor to being a wall.

In that context, “my room is enough” is not aesthetic minimalism. It is triage.

# Thoughts are not orders. They’re just… weather

“A thought is only a thought. It is not an order, not a prophecy, not a fact.”

This is the most scientifically useful sentence in the whole list. It’s basically cognitive behavioral therapy stripped of its corporate polish. The mind has a tragic habit of mistaking internal narrative for external reality. It says: *I am doomed*, and the body hears: *doom is present*. The mind says: *I will never recover*, and the body starts acting like recovery is illegal.

A thought is a neuronal event. A little pattern of firing, a temporary coalition of cells, a chemical flicker. It doesn’t deserve the respect we give it. It certainly doesn’t deserve obedience.

And yet I obey my thoughts all the time. I obey them like a fearful employee obeying a petty boss. I believe the stories. I let them decide my day. I let them colonize the hour, the minute, the breath.

“This breath is mine. No one can touch it, rush it, or own it but me.”

Breath is the only thing in my life that is both automatic and negotiable. It happens without consent, and yet you can take the steering wheel for a while. That’s almost philosophical: the one place where the body offers you a lever.

There’s an Upanishadic line that gets quoted with the swagger of spiritual supremacy, but I read it differently when I’m not in the mood for nationalism: “ईशावास्यमिदं सर्वं”—*īśāvāsyam idaṃ sarvaṃ*—all this is pervaded. People use it to say “everything is divine.” Fine. But you can also read it as: everything is connected, and therefore your nervous system is not separate from the world’s cruelty. The world leaks into you. So you build a room. You build a door. You build a breath.

Not enlightenment. Plumbing.

# The body remembers, and it’s annoyingly literate

“I survived what is past. The body remembers, but the danger is not here now.”

The body remembers in the way a frightened dog remembers. It doesn’t remember with sentences. It remembers with tension. It remembers with sudden heat in the face, with jaw clenching, with that quick flare of anger that feels righteous until you notice it’s actually fear wearing armor.

Trauma, if we must use that word (it’s overused but not fake), is partly the miscalibration of the threat detector. The amygdala is not a wise old judge. It’s a smoke alarm that goes off when you burn toast. It would rather wake you up a thousand times than miss one real fire. Evolution loves false positives. Evolution doesn’t care if you’re tired.

So when a person becomes a storm—voice raised, contempt leaking, the old familiar script of disrespect—the body yells *past!* and floods the system with readiness: fight, flight, freeze. My mind then adds commentary like a sports announcer: *Look at this, the usual humiliation, the familiar failure, the evidence that you are worthless.* And that’s the moment where I have to become unromantic and technical. Feet on floor. Slow exhale. Notebook vomit. One corridor walk.

Not because it makes me “better.” Because it reduces the error rate.

# Small life, not small worth

“I am allowed a small, quiet life. Size does not measure worth.”

This one embarrasses me, which is how I know it’s important. Because I grew up in a culture that worships bigness. Big jobs, big weddings, big salaries, big moral claims, big national pride, big loud religiosity, big everything—noise as proof of existence. In Bengal we add our own special sauce: big intellect, big opinions, big literary nostalgia. Everyone is Tagore in their own head.

And then there’s me, fifty-ish, in a room that could be rented out as a storage unit, trying to convince myself that a quiet day with tea and a book is not failure, it is life.

“People can be storms; I am not obliged to stand in the rain. I may step inside.”

This is also about power. India is a country where power is often petty, local, face-to-face: the uncle who uses shame as currency, the official who uses delay as dominance, the neighbor who uses noise as territory. There is a national-scale version too, of course—grandstanding, myth-making, the endless attempt to convert history into propaganda—but the daily grind is where the nervous system gets chewed.

Stepping inside is not cowardice. It’s refusing to donate your bloodstream to someone else’s drama.

There’s a verse from the Bhagavata Purana that people recite as theology, but you can steal it for psychology if you’re a shameless atheist thief like me: “वदन्ति तत् तत्त्वविदः”—*vadanti tat tattva-vidaḥ*—those who know reality speak of truth. I like the implication more than the doctrine: reality is not your feelings. Reality is not your humiliation narrative. Reality is what is, here, now—feet, floor, fan, tea, book, breath.

# Anger: the world’s worst advisor, and my most loyal employee

“My anger is a signal, not a master. I can notice it, breathe, and let it cool.”

Anger is the easiest emotion to respect because it comes with posture. It makes you feel tall. It makes you feel correct. It makes you feel like you have a spine. Sometimes it’s even true. Often it’s a cover for hurt.

I am Bengali; we specialize in intellectualizing pain until it becomes an essay, and then we mistake the essay for healing. I can write fifteen hundred words about capitalism and colonial hangovers and algorithmic degradation of attention—and not once admit that I felt small when someone spoke to me like I was disposable.

So yes: anger is a signal. It points to something violated—dignity, boundary, expectation. But if you make it master, it turns you into a puppet. It drags you into arguments that are not about truth but about dominance. It makes you say things you cannot unsay.

The ritual is a leash. Not a cure. A leash.

# Tea, book, meal: the microscopic reasons to not die today

“I return to simple things: tea, a book, a meal. These are enough to justify a day.”

This is where my taste for melodrama gets quietly sabotaged by reality. Because sometimes the grand existential question—*what is the point of my life now that the future looks like a locked door*—is answered by something almost insultingly small: the taste of tea, the weight of a book, the heat of rice.

A book is a portable hallucination invented by dead people. You open it and a voice from 1890 or 1957 or 300 BCE starts talking to you, and for a while your own internal narrator shuts up. This is not minor. This is a miracle so ordinary we barely notice.

A meal is chemistry you can chew. Carbohydrates turning into glucose, glucose feeding neurons that then generate the illusion of self. The self, which spends most of its time complaining, is literally powered by starch. That is humiliating and comforting at once.

Tea is water plus leaf plus time. A controlled steeping. It’s a ritual that says: pause. Let flavor leak out slowly. Let the world wait.

And this is the point where I almost become—disgusting word—grateful. Not in the Instagram way. In the tired way. In the way a person feels after surviving yet another day of being himself.

# One small piece at a time, which is not wisdom, it’s just arithmetic

“I will take life one small piece at a time: this breath, this minute, this act of care.”

We like to think we live in narratives, but we actually live in increments. The mind tells epic stories; the body lives in seconds.

My life, if I zoom out, looks like a half-finished bridge: some impressive spans, then gaps. The story of the promising boy with English-medium polish, the Jadavpur engineer, the GRE score, the American years, the respectable institutional work, and then the return and the failure and the long flat plain after.

But if I zoom in, it’s mostly just minutes. Minutes survived. Minutes wasted. Minutes spent staring at a wall. Minutes spent reading. Minutes spent feeling ashamed for wasting minutes. A recursion of regret.

So I prefer the smaller unit: breath. One inhale, one exhale. A thought arrives. I don’t have to salute it. I can watch it pass like a mosquito I’m too tired to kill.

There is a kind of quiet defiance in that. Not heroic defiance. Not “I will conquer the world.” More like: I will not let the world conquer my nervous system for free.

# The door, again

At some point after a stressful interaction—maybe a call, maybe a neighbor’s remark, maybe the soft cruelty of a family expectation—I do the stupid ritual. I go back to my room. I close the door.

Feet on floor. Slow exhale.

I open the cheap notebook. The pen scratches. The sentences are ugly. I write “Met X. Hate this.” I write “This made me angry because…” and I surprise myself with the answer, which is often embarrassingly simple: because I felt disrespected, because I felt unseen, because I felt like my life had become a joke and someone laughed at the punchline.

Then I do one body thing. A stretch. A few slow squats. A corridor walk where I look at nothing in particular and everything feels slightly unreal, as if I’m watching myself from a corner of the ceiling.

And then I come back. I sit. The fan continues its useless rotation. The outside world continues its noise. The future remains unresolved. My failures do not vanish. My politics do not suddenly become optimistic. The country does not become sane. The algorithms do not apologize.

But there is a small pocket of stillness, like a dry patch in a wet street.

The room is enough.

Not forever. Not as a philosophy. As a tactic. As a way to keep the storms from renting space inside my chest.

I reach for the book on the table—some science thing, because of course it is; I have always trusted equations more than people—and I read a paragraph that I will probably forget, and I take another breath that no one can own, and I let the day shrink to something survivable.

Then, because I’m me, I delete the three sentences I just wrote, rewrite them, hate the rewrite, keep it anyway, and turn off the light like I’m closing the lid on a noisy machine.

That’s all I’ve got for now.
