The plastic chair outside the tea-stall has a hairline crack that opens like a tiny mouth whenever I shift my weight, as if the chair itself is doing a small, exhausted concentric commentary on my existence—*tsk, tsk, another middle-aged Bengali man applying pressure where he has no business applying pressure*—and the stall-owner, in a vest that used to be white in some earlier geological era, is stirring my tea with the devotion of a priest and the hygiene of an archaeologist. Beside his foot, an open drain performs its endless wet throat-clearing, a gurgle that isn’t quite water and isn’t quite air and is definitely not a metaphor but also, maddeningly, is nothing *but* metaphor if you have the curse of being the kind of person who sees symbols everywhere, even in sewage.

This is South Calcutta’s boondocks, which is a phrase that should not exist—boondocks are supposed to be rural, and Calcutta is supposed to be a city, and yet here we are, an urban organism that keeps trying to grow new limbs while the old ones are infected, a metropolis that has learned to do *simultaneous arithmetic*: one part colonial boudoir, one part IT brochure, one part crumbling communist mural, one part religious loudspeaker, and eight parts “please don’t look closely at the plumbing,” like a family that bought a chandelier before paying the rent.

A mosquito—*Aedes aegypti*, my tiny airborne loan shark—lands on my forearm with the calm entitlement of a landlord; I slap it, miss, feel the sting begin anyway (the universe loves a good sequel), and in that small moment I remember, as the tea arrives in a glass that burns my fingertips, that Calcutta is not merely a location but an instruction manual for disappointment: step one, desire; step two, delay; step three, infection; step four, poetry.

# The City As A Digestive Tract

People want cities to be minds. “The city thinks,” they say. “The city dreams.” “The city has a soul.” This is what you say when you’re trying to sell real estate or justify suffering or both. Calcutta is not a mind. Calcutta is a digestive tract—vast, noisy, peristaltic, prone to spasms—taking in raw material (people, ambition, ideology, fish, slogans, limestone, lies), breaking it down with acids (bureaucracy, class, heat, habit), and producing output that nobody wants to claim as their own.

And because I’m me—bookish, underpaid by the cosmos, living in a shanty background with a brain that has too many books and not enough serotonin—I can’t sit in front of an open drain without thinking about entropy, that grand, indifferent accountant of the universe. Order is expensive. Disorder is on discount. Disorder is practically free. Disorder will, given enough time, crawl into your kitchen through a gap in the window, breed in the stagnant water behind your fridge, and then run for office.

The drain bubbles. A bubble pops. A smell rises—phenyl failing heroically against a tide of biology—and I have the sudden ridiculous urge to bow to it, not out of devotion but recognition: *yes, yes, this is what we are, this is what our institutions produce when the speeches end.* We are *Homo sapiens*, the wise apes, turning starch into opinion and opinion into sewage and sewage into yet another reason to blame somebody else.

My phone vibrates with a news notification—some fresh outrage, some ancient scam with a modern font—and I feel the familiar bipolar toggling: the hypomanic part of my mind wants to connect everything to everything (quantum entanglement and Hilsa prices and the pothole that has outlived three administrations), while the depressive part says, flatly, *it’s all the same sludge, stop pretending your metaphors are salvation*.

The tea tastes like sugar and smoke and the ghost of cardamom.

Calcutta tastes like that too.

# Names, Lies, And Other Municipal Services

“Kolkata,” “Calcutta,” “Kalikata”—pick your syllables like you pick your poison. People love folk etymologies the way they love horoscopes: because it feels good to pretend the world is legible. I’ve heard the whole menu: derived from Kali, derived from shells, derived from some ancient village name, derived from destiny itself. The truth, as far as I can tell, is both boring and fascinating: it’s probably a tangle of local toponyms and colonial ears and administrative paperwork, which is to say, the city began as a misunderstanding and has remained loyal to its origins.

The British arrived, misheard, renamed, extracted, and then left behind the architectural equivalent of a half-eaten sandwich—Victorian buildings like grand dentures in a mouth that can no longer chew. Now we rename again, not because renaming fixes anything but because it’s cheaper than drainage. A new signboard costs less than a new system. A new slogan costs less than clean water. We are a civilization of paint.

And I say “we,” which is always the first lie. The rich don’t live in my drain-scented boondocks. The powerful don’t need to step around garbage like it’s a landmine field of shame. They inhabit the city the way a god inhabits a myth: above consequence, immune to smell. They get Calcutta as romance. I get Calcutta as mildew.

But I’m not innocent. I’m never innocent. I have my own small hypocrisies—my own private empires built on denial. I complain about the system while using the system; I despise grandstanding while writing paragraphs that are basically a one-man parade; I mock superstition while checking my own mood like a priest checks auspicious timings. Even my atheism sometimes has the smugness of faith. *Look at me, Ma, I don’t believe in anything*—as if disbelief is a personality and not merely the absence of a coping mechanism.

The Upanishads mutter, like an ancient neighbor who has seen too much: **असतो मा सद्गमय, तमसो मा ज्योतिर्गमय, मृत्योर्मा अमृतं गमय**—lead me from the unreal to the real, from darkness to light, from death to immortality—and I can’t tell whether the line is a lantern or a joke, because the unreal is often better furnished than the real, and darkness at least hides the stains.

# Tea-Shop Metaphysics (And Other Cheap Drugs)

At the tea-stall, two men argue about politics with the confidence of Nobel laureates and the evidentiary standards of toddlers. One says the country is doomed. The other says the country is glorious. Neither has a budget spreadsheet. Neither has a sanitation plan. Both have very loud lungs. The stall-owner ignores them the way the universe ignores all of us: with a practiced neutrality.

I listen, half-amused, half-tired, and my mind does the thing it always does—starts building a theory of everything out of street noise. Somewhere in a CERN tunnel, protons are being whipped into near-light-speed collisions so we can understand the fundamental particles, the quarks and leptons and bosons, the tiny alphabet of reality; here, in my lane, two uncles are colliding opinions at near-light-speed so they can understand absolutely nothing. Both collisions produce heat. Only one produces publishable data.

If I were a better person, I would join them. If I were a wiser person, I would leave. Instead I sip my tea and become the third kind of Calcutta man: the observer with a superiority complex, hiding behind skepticism like it’s a shield, as if not believing in anyone’s story exempts me from the need to live in one.

The thing about tea-shops is that they are small parliaments without consequences. Everyone gets to speak; nobody has to implement. In that sense, they are the purest form of democracy: noise without plumbing, rights without responsibility, freedom without maintenance. It’s intoxicating. It’s also why we remain, generation after generation, in love with our own commentary and indifferent to our own infrastructure.

I think about how in physics, the most powerful truths are often symmetry statements: the laws of nature don’t care where you are, or when you are, or how you rotate your coordinate system. The universe is, in a cold way, fair. Calcutta is not symmetrical. Calcutta cares very much where you are—north, south, gated, slum, “posh,” “busti”—and it cares what your father did, what your accent does, what your skin suggests, what your address implies, what your shoes confess.

Yet we still demand metaphysics from it, like children demanding a bedtime story from a broken fan.

Rigveda whispers another line I can’t unhear: **एकं सद्विप्रा बहुधा वदन्ति**—truth is one, the wise speak of it in many ways. Beautiful. Dangerous too. Because in the wrong hands, it becomes license for bullshit: *everything is one, therefore my nonsense is also wisdom.* Calcutta is full of people who confuse many ways of speaking with many versions of reality.

I include myself. Of course I do.

# Bipolar Weather Report

There are mornings when the city feels almost tender. Sunlight hits a wet wall and turns it into gold. A crow caws like an old comedian. A child runs with a schoolbag that’s too big, carrying the future like a poorly packed suitcase. On those mornings, my hypomania arrives like a caffeinated professor: *Look, Suvro, see how everything connects—drainage to empire, tea to labor economics, mosquitoes to climate, shame to caste, your loneliness to algorithms.* I scribble notes. I draft sentences. I feel briefly like a person with purpose, which is the most intoxicating drug I have ever taken, and I have taken some stupid drugs—doomscrolling, nostalgia, self-pity, the fantasy of being understood.

Then the mood shifts, as it does, with no cosmic decency to announce itself.

Suddenly the same wall is just wet. The same crow is just noise. The child is not the future but an overburdened body in a failing system. My notes look pretentious. My sentences look like fraud. The drain smell is not metaphor but evidence. In depression, my mind becomes brutally literal: the city is broken, you are broken, and your cleverness is merely decorative ruin.

I delete drafts obsessively. I rewrite. I rewrite the rewrite. Sometimes I delete the whole thing with a petty, righteous pleasure—*there, take that, universe; I refused to produce content.* Then, an hour later, I open a blank page again like an addict returning to the dealer, because writing is the only way I know to turn mental noise into something shaped, even if the shape is a mess.

People romanticize bipolarity, as if it’s a creative superpower, as if suffering is a quirky accessory. It’s not. It’s an electrical fault in the house wiring, occasionally producing pretty sparks, often producing smoke, always leaving you suspicious of the light switch. I don’t glamorize it because I can’t. I live inside it. I pay rent to it.

Calcutta doesn’t help. Calcutta is mood-congruent. When you’re up, it gives you stories. When you’re down, it gives you receipts.

# Colonial Aftertaste, Capitalist Hangover

Sometimes I imagine the city as a palimpsest—the old text scraped off, new text written on top, old text still bleeding through—except the scraping was done with a dull knife by people who didn’t care if the parchment survived. The colonial period left behind rail lines and institutions and a particular flavor of contempt; the postcolonial period added bureaucracy and slogans and a talent for rearranging poverty into different shapes; the neoliberal period slapped on glossy ads for luxury apartments that stare down at the slum like a smug moral lesson: *if you worked harder, you too could escape the smell.*

The education system—my old frenemy—taught me to worship marks and English and obedience, to treat curiosity as a side hobby and conformity as a career. It also gave me books, and books are the only reason I’m not fully dead inside. So I’m caught in that classic Bengali contradiction: I despise the machinery that produced me, and I can’t deny I am its product, like a man who hates cigarettes while still smelling faintly of smoke.

Capitalism, in this city, is not the clean, efficient market of textbook fantasy. It’s a bazaar with a dress code. It’s rent-seeking with better fonts. It’s the same old hierarchy wearing a new shirt, insisting it’s modern now because it has an app. And technology—the great promised liberator—often arrives here as a way to monetize helplessness: food delivery because walking is unsafe, ride-hailing because public transport is exhausted, online learning because schools are broken, digital payments because cash was always a leak. Progress is sometimes just a new layer of coping.

I look at my phone again, that glowing rectangle of manufactured anxiety, and I think: we have built a machine that can deliver dopamine on demand and information without context and outrage without cost. No wonder the tea-shop uncles sound like angry prophets. No wonder I sound like one too. We are being trained—conditioned, like lab animals—to react, react, react, until reaction replaces thought.

And still, I keep the phone. Because I’m not a monk. I’m a man in a shanty background with a taste for knowledge and a weakness for distraction, which is just a fancy way of saying: I’m ordinary.

# The Myth Of Glorious Anything

There’s a genre of story Indians love, across classes and ideologies: the “we used to be great” story. It comes in many costumes—civilizational supremacy, religious nostalgia, nationalist fever, sometimes even scientific name-dropping—but it always delivers the same emotional product: pride without work, identity without responsibility, a warm blanket over a cold reality.

I have no patience for it. Not because the past wasn’t complex or impressive—history is messy and full of human genius—but because the “glory” narrative is usually a substitute for plumbing. It’s a way to feel tall while standing in sewage. It’s a way to avoid the humiliating truth that greatness is maintenance: roads, drains, schools, hospitals, public trust, boring competence.

Yes, ancient texts are fascinating. Yes, old architecture is astonishing. Yes, human beings have always been clever. But if your response to a broken present is to chant about a shining past, you are not honoring your ancestors; you’re using them as emotional blackmail.

And here I catch myself, because I too have my own “we used to be great” story, only mine is personal. I was bookish. I was promising. I was going to do something. I was going to be the kind of man whose name appears on things that matter. Now I’m fifty-ish, living in the south Calcutta boondocks, writing long essays like a stranded radio station broadcasting to the fog.

My superiority narratives are smaller, but they are still narratives. My ego wears intellectualism the way some men wear gold chains. It jingles when I move.

Somewhere in the background, the old line floats up again—**कर्मण्येवाधिकारस्ते**—you have a right to action, not to the fruits (yes, I know, not a Purana line; the point is the humiliation embedded in it), and I resent it because it’s true in the way gravity is true: unfair, impersonal, non-negotiable.

# A Small Inventory Of My Complicity

I want to blame the politicians, the bureaucrats, the colonial hangover, the capitalist vultures, the neighbor who throws garbage into the drain like it’s a sacred offering.

I do blame them.

Then I remember: I also throw things away mentally. I outsource responsibility to mood. I postpone. I fantasize. I choose comfort over discipline and then pretend my failure is purely structural. I use sarcasm as armor. I use erudition as camouflage. I talk about entropy while letting my own room become entropic. I am, in miniature, the same problem I accuse the city of being in macro: too much talk, not enough maintenance.

Some days I even enjoy the decay, because it justifies my bitterness. If the world is a septic tank, then my despair is reasonable. My nihilism becomes a kind of moral cleanliness: *I don’t participate in illusions,* I tell myself, as if cynicism is the same as clarity. It isn’t. Cynicism is often just depression with better vocabulary.

The tea-stall argument has moved on. Now they’re discussing the price of fish, which is the most honest economics seminar in the city. One of them says Hilsa has become a luxury for the poor. The other says everything is luxury now. They laugh. The laugh is real. That’s what gets me. Even knee-deep in problems, *Homo sapiens* will find a way to make a joke, because laughter is our last remaining public utility.

For a moment, I feel something like tenderness for these men, for the stall-owner, for myself—this whole ridiculous species, trying to negotiate meaning in a universe that doesn’t issue refunds.

Then the drain gurgles again, and the spell breaks, and I’m back inside my head, where the lights flicker.

# The Only Defiance I Can Afford

I finish the tea. The glass leaves a sticky ring on the wooden counter, a small mandala of sugar and dust. I pay with coins that have passed through countless palms, carrying microbes and history like a tiny circulating library. The stall-owner nods without looking at me; he has seen my type, and he has also seen far worse.

I stand, stretch my back, feel the chair’s cracked mouth close in relief.

Walking home, I pass a small shrine wedged into a wall—marigolds, incense, a smudged image—someone has asked the universe for mercy in the only language they trust. I don’t believe. I still pause, not out of worship but out of respect for the human need to plead. I continue past, stepping over a puddle that reflects the sky like an accidental philosophy: above us, vast indifferent blue; below us, street water of uncertain parentage pretending to be a mirror.

At home, I open my laptop, stare at the blank page, and feel the familiar urge to either write everything or delete everything.

I type anyway.

Not because I think it will fix Calcutta, or fix me, or purify the drain, or shame the powerful into competence.

I type because this is the one small gesture of defiance I can afford: to look at the septic tank honestly, to refuse the romance without surrendering to pure rot, to admit that I am ridiculous and complicit and frightened and occasionally lucid, and to leave behind, for whoever stumbles upon it, a smear of language on the wall that says—without neat morals, without self-help perfume, without holy conclusions—

I was here. I noticed. I laughed, a little. I kept my irony. I kept the light on for another minute.

Then I save the draft, consider deleting it, and instead—almost shyly—turn off the screen.
