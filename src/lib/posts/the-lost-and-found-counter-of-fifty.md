At 1:47 a.m. the phone does that small, humiliating thing—lights up for no reason, a phantom notification, the rectangle of glass briefly becoming an aquarium where my own face floats, older, more porous, like it’s been left too long in water. The room smells faintly of kerosene from the stairwell. Outside, a dog negotiates territory with another dog in the language of exhausted threats. Inside, my thumb does the daily pilgrimage: wake screen, unlock, open the same app, scroll past the same faces. Love at fifty is not the operatic thing it promised when I was seventeen and prone to melodrama in cheap ballpoint; it is mostly this—missing people, and the long, dull, oddly physical ache of realizing you can miss someone without even wanting them back, the way you can miss a childhood knee without desiring the scrape.

In adolescence, love was mutinous. It was a little rebellion staged inside my ribs against everything that was already arranged—grades, relatives’ expectations, the grim certainty that “a good boy” would become “a good husband” like a clerk becomes a superintendent. Love was allegory then: I could take any girl’s sideways glance and turn it into a novel. It was illusion too, but not in the cheap way people say “illusion” now, as if the only alternative to being fooled is being smug. Illusion, for a boy in North Calcutta with too many books and too little sunlight, was a mode of transport. You couldn’t go anywhere in the city without being pushed by bodies, so you learned to travel inward. One smile could launch an empire.

Now the empire is mostly paperwork.

There’s a particular fatigue in missing people that romance never warned you about, because romance is written by the young, and the young think time is an ocean they can sip. Missing people is the bureaucratic end of emotion: you keep a mental file—name, last seen, distinguishing marks, probable direction of disappearance. The mind becomes a police station with bad lighting, where the officer behind the desk (me) keeps saying, *Write it down, file it, we’ll see,* while the complainant (also me) insists, *But it’s urgent, he was here yesterday, I swear.*

Yesterday in this context can mean 1996.

The thing about Calcutta—about any city, but ours does it with special flair—is that it doesn’t just lose people. It loses versions. You run into a schoolmate after twenty years and you’re both startled, not by age, but by the absence of the person you were in the same room with. A face can be familiar while the soul behind it has moved out, leaving only the old furniture. You stand there with polite sentences—how are you, what are you doing, where are you living now—and underneath, a private grief: I can’t find us.

So love becomes a kind of missing-persons bureau, except nobody admits it because we have been trained—especially men, especially Bengali men—to mistake emotional constipation for character. Patriarchy, that ancient municipal corporation, has painted it as virtue: feel less, speak less, make your wife do the translation work. Nationalism adds its own syrupy propaganda: love the motherland, love the flag, love the myth, love the leader’s beard, love everything except an actual human being with needs and contradictions. I don’t say this to sound righteous; I say it because I have participated, willingly, in the whole ridiculous industry of not saying what I felt and then wondering why the world didn’t read my silence correctly. *Ah yes,* the classic scientific method: refuse to publish your data, then complain nobody cites you.

Science is useful here because it is ruthlessly unsentimental. It doesn’t care that you wrote poetry in a notebook with a torn cover. It asks: what is the signal, what is the noise, what did you actually observe?

At seventeen, love felt like a clean signal. A single frequency, loud enough to drown the street. At fifty, it’s more like an inverse problem: you don’t measure the thing itself; you measure its effects, and then you try to reconstruct what caused them. Like astronomy—nobody has touched a star, we infer it from photons that left before our grandparents were born. Missing people is astrophysics in a cheap T-shirt: you look at the light that remains and imagine the body that produced it. Sometimes the body is gone and you’re still catching the light.

The mind is not a faithful instrument, of course. It’s a badly calibrated sensor that also writes editorials. It will take one remembered sentence—said by a girl outside a coaching center, or a friend in College Street, or a lover in a rented room—and amplify it until it becomes a creed. It will also do the opposite: compress whole years into a thumbnail and then mislabel it “Nothing much happened.” Depression is a sort of malicious data compression algorithm; it takes the high-resolution footage of your life and saves it as a corrupted file, then plays it back with missing frames. Hypomania, its annoying cousin, is the opposite: it upscales everything into sharpness it doesn’t deserve, makes a casual gesture into a prophecy, makes you believe you are starring in a film even when you are merely buying eggs.

Love at seventeen was full of that kind of confident nonsense. You could build an entire metaphysics out of a glance and a half-smile, and nobody could falsify it because you never asked the subject of your metaphysics for peer review. The girls were real, of course, but the love was mostly a private mythology, a little temple inside the skull where I was both priest and god and devotee. Convenient arrangement: no accountability, no chores, no difference between fantasy and truth. When I became an atheist, I didn’t stop worshipping; I just changed the object. I began to worship *possibility*. I began to worship *the idea of being chosen*.

At fifty, the worship has turned into inventory.

I think of the missing people the way I think of missing data in a spreadsheet—an ugly metaphor, but accurate in its ugliness. Some entries are blank because the measurement was never taken. Some are blank because the data existed and was lost. Some are blank because someone deliberately deleted it and then told you the file was never there. Relationships have all three kinds of missingness. There are loves I never pursued because I was timid, because the city taught me to be both overconfident and terrified, because my *para* trained me in sarcasm but not in courage. There are loves that happened and then evaporated—no villain, no great betrayal, just the slow leak of attention and the steady pressure of life. And there are loves that were sabotaged by systems: family expectations, money, class, the quiet brutality of “what will people say,” the way women are expected to carry everyone’s emotional luggage while men swagger around pretending their hands are empty.

I can hear a conservative voice in my head—everybody has one, like a cockroach in the kitchen—that says: stop blaming systems, take responsibility. Fine. I take responsibility. I was often insufferable. I treated emotional labor like a service that should run in the background. I wanted understanding without explanation, forgiveness without apology, intimacy without vulnerability. I was—how to put it—an overeducated bargain hunter in the market of love, haggling for the best deal in feelings. The universe, which has a dark sense of humor, usually gives such people exactly what they deserve: solitude with a library.

And yet, missing people is not merely regret. It’s something stranger. It’s the persistence of attachment even after the story ends. I used to think love was a function: input person, output feeling. Clean, computable, the kind of thing a naïve engineer might attempt to model on a whiteboard. At fifty it looks more like a differential equation with long memory, a system where the present depends on the entire history, where the initial conditions haunt you. You don’t just “move on.” You carry forward the boundary conditions, and they shape the solution whether you admit it or not.

Sometimes a smell does it. Not the obvious ones. Not roses or perfume or some cinematic nonsense. A particular cheap hair oil I catch near a bus stop, and suddenly I’m back in a classroom, watching the back of someone’s head and inventing a future I didn’t have the right to invent. Or a certain brand of detergent on someone’s shirt in the Metro, and I’m standing in a rented room in another decade, counting coins, pretending I’m not worried about the future because I have read enough philosophy to look calm. Philosophy, by the way, is a brilliant way to avoid feeling things. You can quote Spinoza while your heart is on fire. You can discuss Camus while you are starving for a message.

I’m aware I’m drifting toward the familiar—North Calcutta nostalgia, College Street romance, the classic “remember when” parade. It’s a comfortable trap, like an old armchair with springs poking your back. So let me swerve.

The truth is, the missing people are not only lovers. They are friends who left—some to America, some to Bangalore, some to early graves, some to domestic lives that don’t have room for my late-night monologues. They are the versions of my parents that existed before the world wore them down. They are my own earlier selves: the boy who believed intelligence would be rewarded, the young man who believed merit was a currency, the husband who believed love could run on autopilot like a ceiling light. (Even now I hesitate to write that last word, “husband,” because it drags in all the unflattering evidence, and I am still a little boy trying to look clever.)

When people talk about loneliness, they often mean the absence of company. That’s the cheap version. The expensive version—the one that costs you sleep—is the absence of *witness*. At seventeen, even heartbreak had an audience: friends, poems, the grand theater of being young. At fifty, longing is quieter and therefore more dangerous. It doesn’t announce itself. It leaks into everything. You find yourself doing the dishes and suddenly you’re furious at someone who isn’t in your life anymore. You’re buying vegetables and suddenly you’re tender toward a memory that has no practical use. You’re standing in line and you imagine, with startling clarity, the life you might have had if you had said one honest sentence at the right time.

In colonial history there’s this persistent fantasy—that the colonized subject is always looking at the colonizer, always measuring himself against that yardstick, always yearning for that approval. There’s truth in it, yes, but it’s also a comforting story for the ex-empire: it puts them at the center even in our grief. The more humiliating truth is that most longing is domestic. It’s not for London or Washington. It’s for a certain kind of ease you glimpsed briefly in your own life and then misplaced. It’s for a room where you didn’t have to perform. It’s for a person who knew your worst sentences and stayed anyway. It’s for the version of yourself that could laugh without checking the balance sheet first.

The political climate doesn’t help. Everywhere, authority is louder and dumber, demanding allegiance like a drunk demanding applause. Mythology is sold as history, history is sold as rage, rage is sold as virtue. The old male models—dominate, acquire, breed, retire—are presented as timeless truth, as if the universe itself issued a press release saying men must be granite and women must be glue. I don’t buy it. I didn’t buy it when I was young, and I buy it even less now, though I’ve still inhaled its fumes. The worst part of patriarchy isn’t just what it does to women; it’s what it does to men’s inner weather. It turns them into droughts and then congratulates them on being dry.

So what do you do with love when the romantic machinery has rusted and the missing persons keep piling up?

Mostly you cope badly. You scroll. You intellectualize. You make jokes in your head to avoid crying in public. You drink too much tea. You rehearse arguments with people who don’t know they’re in a debate. You cultivate *obhiman*—that Bengali pride-pain mixture—because it gives your longing a spine.

But occasionally something smaller happens, something that doesn’t deserve the grand name of hope. A neighbor’s child drops a toy on the stairs and laughs at his own clumsiness. A stray cat sits near the gate like it pays rent. A friend, long absent, sends a message that is not profound—just a photo of a book, a line about the weather—and for a moment the mind stops behaving like a police station and becomes, briefly, a living room.

Tonight, after the phantom notification fades and the room goes dark again, I put the phone face-down as if it’s a rude guest. I open the window a crack. The city offers its usual inventory: distant traffic, a late bus groaning, the wet cough of someone’s aging throat, the smell of frying oil from a stall that refuses to sleep. Somewhere a man is singing badly and with conviction, which is, when you think about it, the purest form of faith available.

I stand there for a minute longer than necessary, hands on the grille, and then I do the only sensible thing a fifty-year-old rationalist in South Calcutta can do with his heart’s missing-persons register.

I switch off the light and let the darkness keep the file.
