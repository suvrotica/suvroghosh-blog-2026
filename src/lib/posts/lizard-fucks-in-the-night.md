I woke up with a sour-metal taste in my mouth, which I first assumed was the consequence of my own nocturnal gastric reflux—my middle-aged Bengali esophagus now rebels against gravity itself, hurling up half-digested acid memories at 3:42 AM like a vengeful ex who can’t shut the fuck up—but no, this wasn’t mine, not my flavor; this was stranger, greasy, meatier, like someone else’s vomit had taken a lazy detour through my sinuses.

Or maybe it was the smell.

A stench—burnt hair, menstrual discharge, reheated mutton fat, and something else, something fucking *alive*. I flung off my mosquito net (which had developed two polite rectangular holes from last month’s rat adventures, like little diplomatic entrances for bloodsuckers) and stared at the patch of cracked plaster above my bookshelf—where one fat house gecko used to squat with the resigned confidence of a retired communist—only to find that the bastard was gone. Gone.

In its place: a smear. A gelatinous, iridescent *smear*.

I sat there, twitching in my boxers with one testicle stuck to my thigh, the room thick with humidity and the faint whir of the ceiling fan that only spins fast enough to redistribute the stink evenly. Dream still clinging to me like an unwashed petticoat.

In the dream, someone—some *thing*—was slinking around my room. Not walking, not floating, just *sliding*, like sex with no friction, a fuck without thrust. It, or they, or some collective interdimensional jizzforce, had entered through the broken bathroom window. They wore no shoes, smelled like dried sardines and semen, and *ate* the fucking geckos. Not with reverence. Like chips. Like bar snacks. One even licked the lime wedge off the last lizard’s tail like it was tequila Tuesday in hell.

I didn’t scream. I jerked off.

I don't know what that says about me. Probably something Kafka would’ve scribbled down before going for his 15th coughing fit of the morning and shitting blood into a Vienna pisspot.

But here’s the thing that nags the root of my flaccid soul like a rotting wisdom tooth: I *liked* it. The dream. The consumption. The obscenity of being watched, violated, then ignored, like some useless museum exhibit—*Old Cunt in Captivity*—as the real party happened on my mould-slick walls, featuring the geckos I’ve shared this rotting shanty with for a decade. I name them, you know? That one was Montu. He shat exactly in the corner of the rice cooker lid. Every day. Precision shitting. You don’t get that kind of loyalty from family.

But they ate him. In my dream, they slurped Montu up like an oyster. I remember the crunch.

And the worst part? One of them—slimy, big-titted fuck with a mouth like a prolapsed cloaca—*waved* at me. Friendly-like.



What the fuck is it about dreams that lets your subconscious serve you a hot turd and say, “bon appétit,” while Freud and Jung simultaneously jerk each other off over a dead parrot’s cage?

Because it felt real. Not real like taxes or cancer, but real like stubbing your toe on the corner of colonialism. Real like discovering your toothpaste has fungus because your bathroom tiles are made from 1947 regret and fungus *grows upwards*, like hope. And when I woke up, the slime on the wall shimmered in the orange light from the godforsaken sodium lamp outside.

So I did what any respectable lunatic would do—I licked it.

Yes, you judgmental titweasel. I fucking licked it.

Metallic. Slightly spicy. Familiar.

Like the old mutton kosha from Golpark that gave me gonorrhea-adjacent gas in 2003. That was the year I tried dating a junior from Presidency College who quoted Sartre during head, and later left me for a Naxalite who wrote poetry about menstrual blood and once burned down an ATM.

But this—this slime—was *not of this Earth*.



I googled it. At 4:07 AM. With one finger because the other hand was scratching my armpit like it owed me money.

Turns out, some lizards secrete peptides when threatened. Bioactive compounds. Some used in experimental diabetes meds. Some *psychotropic*. Some can fuck with your dreams. There’s a gecko in Vietnam whose skin oozes a chemical *identical* to the human neurotransmitter GABA. The shit you pop in pill form when you want to stop thinking about your ex's thighs or the Rohingya crisis.

Maybe the bastards are licking *me*. Maybe it’s not a dream. Maybe Montu and his cousins have been microdosing me. Maybe I’m their pet. Their hallucinating houseplant.

Don’t scoff, you fart-snorting dipshit. There’s precedent. There’s a fungus in Brazil that infects ants and makes them climb to the highest leaf and die there, just to release spores. There’s a flatworm that takes over a snail’s brain, makes it do a sexy dance for birds, just so it can get eaten and breed in a feathery shithole.

Why not me?

Why not my stupid damp South Calcutta boxroom with its failed network of dreams and that persistent scent of decaying ambition I can’t scrub off the doorknob?



Maybe those fucks in my dream weren’t ghosts or demons or hallucinations.

Maybe they were future versions of me.

Come back from the next recession, when the rupee's worth less than a fart in a cyclone and AI has taken over not just coding but masturbation (yes, even that), and humans are reduced to scraping protein off walls like calcium-deficient termites. What’s left? Gecko sashimi. A little lime. A splash of Maggi hot and sweet.

Maybe I’m watching my own descendants snack on my past.

Maybe I’m not even awake.



Or maybe—and this is the most terrifying hypothesis—there is no dream, no lizard, no slime. Maybe it’s just loneliness. That thick molasses of middle-aged male emptiness you can’t jerk off, talk out, or pray away.

The kind that makes you hallucinate connections in mold stains and reach for meaning in the fart-warmed folds of a tea-stained bedsheet.

I sat on the floor, sweat tracing the line of my cracked tailbone, watching the smear evaporate into nothing. Outside, a dog barked like it had seen a soul.

And I remembered, suddenly, that I hadn’t spoken out loud in four days.



This morning, I made tea. Montu didn’t show up. No shit on the cooker lid.

But a new lizard’s there now.

Smaller. Twitchier.

I’ve named her Titli.

She blinked at me.

I blinked back.

And quietly, without warning, I got hard.
