It began with a wet fart that wasn’t a fart.

You know the kind—stealth missile, phantom squelch, the ghost of last night’s regretful cholar dal passing gaslit judgment on my foolhardy love of reheated parathas with mouldy mango pickle, all fermented nicely overnight in the dank belly pit I call an abdominal cavity. I shifted sideways on the ceramic throne, legs falling asleep like underpaid interns during Zoom calls, unsure whether what exited my body was biodegradable or actively treasonous.

And that, ladies and unwanted gentlemen, is exactly what it feels like to watch America post-Obama.

A swampy, morally ambiguous, low-pressure intestinal expulsion that starts out with relief and ends with a squirming suspicion that something inside you just gave up its will to persist.

Because let’s face it—this corpse-humping festival of fundamentalist fuckery that now calls itself a country has become so aggressively dumb, so fattened on its own delusional gas that it fancies itself chosen—yes, chosen, like some Old Testament's hairy-ass scrotal itch chosen—while turning the Earth into a warming, charring, wheezing perineum of despair. The three-titted mutant prostitute from *Total Recall* is the sanest metaphor I’ve got for it. A nation lactating idiocy from every hormonal extremity. One tit for Fox News. One for AR-15s. And one for Jesus, but only the white Republican version who hates Mexicans and loves capital gains.

The America I jerked off into at 27 in a dorm room in Texas, enchanted by ethernet porn and Einsteinian equations, that America is now six feet under, replaced by an orgy of opioid-slicked, ketamine-snorting, Christian crypto-fascist QAnon tit-suckers who couldn't tell the Bill of Rights from a Waffle House menu if you stapled it to their unvaccinated dicks.

And yet—and here’s where the bile chokes you mid-belch—it’s not even America’s collapse that’s interesting. It’s the theatrical shoddiness of it all. No Caesar, no Caligula, not even a fucking decent Judas to betray the whole charade with style. Just this endless, spite-lubed gangbang of slow learners humping the Constitution like it’s a sex doll filled with dogma and chewed-up Hot Pockets.

Meanwhile, I’m here, in Calcutta—or whatever pseudo-historic, piss-splattered rebranding they’re calling it now—staring out my concrete balcony at a view so depressing it could send a sugar-addled toddler into existential nihilism. Plastic bags flapping like suicide notes, dogs eating dogs, and the faint scent of sewage mixed with incense because of course God must enjoy the stench of a million fermenting bowels disguised as devotion.

Every day I wake up to the stink of mythological diarrhea—Ram and Sita and Shiva and that thunder-thighed blue prick Krishna and his flute of phallic promises. And Jesus, let’s not forget that Middle Eastern magician with six-pack abs and eternal mommy issues. All of them lined up like contestants in some cosmic cock-measuring contest for the privilege of shoving their doctrine deeper up my cracked philosophical sphincter.

There is no liberation. There is no progress. There is only involuntary clenching and the hope that this turd of a civilization doesn’t rupture the septic tank we call a biosphere before I die. Which I hope is soon. I’m not suicidal, I’m just... ready. Ready for the curtain call. The Final Flush.

But no, I must persist. I must fucking endure, because the universe decided to give me just enough stamina to survive but not enough serotonin to enjoy it. So I stew. I seethe. I scroll. I watch the American government turn into a poorly written sequel to *Idiocracy*, only now with nukes and TikTok diplomacy. I see Elon’s muskrat face tweet genocidal crypto-libertarian diarrhea while people call it genius. I watch Texas freeze while their senators flee to Cancun. I see drag queens treated like war criminals while billionaires build rocket dildos to escape the planet they helped destroy.

And India—oh fuck me sideways with a roti roller—India thinks it’s winning. Winning what? A turd polishing contest? A race to see who can package mythology as modernity faster? We are now a people who name Mars missions after gods who couldn’t navigate their own marriages. A country that bans beef but beats women. Builds statues, not sewage lines. And the ruling ideology? A stinking curry of prepuce-chafed masculinity, economic sleight-of-hand, and saffron-dyed derangement cooked up in WhatsApp kitchens by men whose idea of culture is a spreadsheet of enemies and a log of how many times they’ve jerked off to a female news anchor.

What’s left? Nothing.

Nothing but nervous shits and memories of better lies.

Once, I had hope. I believed in the Enlightenment. Not the woo-woo candle-sniffing wellness version but the cold, hard, Kantian ass-slap of reason. I believed in democracy, flawed but functional, in scientists with crooked teeth and dog-eared journals, in collective curiosity, in vaccines, in NASA, in books with spines, in libraries, in the silence between answers.

Now? I believe in bowel regularity. I believe in cheap rice. I believe in not shitting myself during power cuts. I believe in listening to the gecko in my ceiling more than I believe any elected representative.

And I believe—I really, truly believe—that hell is real.

It’s not fire and brimstone.

It’s a WhatsApp group of your extended family, a torn lungi, and the sound of a neighbor’s child learning to play the recorder at 6 a.m. on Republic Day. It’s the realization that the last time you got an erection was during a dream where you were applying for a voter ID. It’s the third tit of modern civilization—vestigial, obscene, and inexplicably sticky.

And I’ll be there. I’ll arrive with a half-flushed turd of hope still bobbing behind me. They’ll greet me with halal pork, Sanskrit hymns, and a thousand-page tax audit. And I’ll say—

“Take me. I’m ready. Just don’t make me listen to another speech about economic growth while the air smells like burning tires and cancer.”

Three tits up.

And no one’s lactating anything worth drinking.
