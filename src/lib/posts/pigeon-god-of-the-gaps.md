The pigeon shat on my rice while I was still chewing.  
I hadn’t even fucking started the second bite—lukewarm rice, cold dal, that tragic purgatory meal of a man who’s lost both money and meaning and yet persists in warming the fucking food like it’s not the third day of the same shit in the same aluminium bowl.  

And there it was. Mid-mastication. Plop. Yellow-greyish-black diarrheic punctuation on top of my parboiled sadness. A Calcutta pigeon, sacred-feathered sidewalk deity of bacteria and bloat, had declared its divine intervention by uncoiling its cloacal enlightenment onto my tiffin.  

Now I know this cocksucker. This exact bird. Probably born on the same oxidizing windowsill where it now worships the sun with the same kind of slack-jawed awe I once reserved for the tits on Monica Bellucci in *Malèna*—except that dumb feathery fuck does it every single day, and gets rewarded with leftover puffed rice and that unmistakable reverence Bengalis reserve for anything fluttering, confused, and entirely unfit for survival.  

You’ll see them—old sagging nipples of the city tossing mustard grains on the temple steps like that’ll bring them a miraculous hernia cure or an erection they don’t deserve.  
And the pigeons? The bastards have been *trained*. Skinner would have fucking loved this city. Operant conditioning in full fuckin’ form.  

Every twitch of their underdeveloped little velociraptor brains is a divine guess. Peck this ledge: food falls. Fly in circle: bell rings. Shit on brown man’s rice: achieve moksha.  

Superstition isn’t a glitch in the software. It’s the goddamn bootloader.  
A safety net for brains too slow to compute causality in real-time, too cowardly to admit randomness, too constipated to accept death.  

And it ain’t just humans doing it, no. I mean these pigeons aren’t just pooping priests in some feathered archdiocese—they are *theologians*.  

Let me tell you about Skinner’s pigeon experiment, right? He tossed some poor dumb birds in a box, fed them pellets at regular intervals, and sat back watching them turn into psychotic ballet dancers. One bird spun counter-clockwise every 15 seconds, thinking its little pirouette summoned the snack. Another did head-bobs like it was in a fucking Punjabi wedding. They invented *rituals* out of dumb luck.  

They thought the random reward was a result of *their* actions.  
And before you say “aww cute,” let me slap you with the mirror.  

You’re the same.  
You bought that fucking crystal. You prayed before your ICSE results. You wore lucky boxers for your prostate exam. You sent your resume after fasting on a Monday.  

You’re the pigeon, my friend. A big-balled, bipedal, Bengali version, jerked off not by the promise of food but by the fantasy that the universe might be listening—when all it’s doing is taking a galactic shit on your rice.

And I know the brain’s in on this racket. We’ve got whole clusters lighting up like Diwali when a “pattern” emerges—even if it’s made of farts and coincidences. Some evolutionary hangover from when seeing a predator *maybe* meant you *maybe* lived one more day to fuck or ferment in your own fear.  

So the amygdala screeches, and the cortex backfills. It’s like one of those half-sober WhatsApp uncles forwarding *“proof of Ram Setu”* images. The emotional trigger hits first. The rationalization arrives later with a fake beard and a WhatsApp degree in ancient aeronautics.  

Now extrapolate this pattern across species.  

A rat hits a lever. Sometimes it gets a shock. Sometimes cheese. It still keeps trying.  
A dog gets fed when the bell rings. Soon it salivates for bells like a pubescent boy salivates for cleavage-shaped clouds.  

So what is God, then, if not the Great Cheese Dispenser of Unpredictable Timing?

Every species has a gap.  
A terror of not-knowing.  
Of chaos.  
Of the yawning cunt of uncertainty.  

So we invent the *filler*. The god. The story.  
The gap gets spackled with semen and psalms and planetary positions and spilled mustard seeds and weird dreams that somehow mean your neighbor’s going to die.  

Pigeons shit on us. We still feed them.  
We shit on each other. Still pray together.  
The whole fucking biosphere’s a circlejerk of magical thinking.  

And you’d think higher IQ might vaccinate you, right?  
That if you studied biology or logic or that you once jerked off to Carl Sagan documentaries, you’d escape this bullshit.  
But no. You just get *cleverer* about hiding it.  
You say “emergent properties.”  
You say “unknown quantum fields.”  
You say “simulated multiverse.”  

Same pigeon, different turd.  

And it’s always funny until it's personal.  

Like when you’ve been alone too long and your dead mother’s old scarf drops off a shelf on a windless day and you feel—deep in your chest, between the ribs and where your anxiety nests—that *maybe* it’s a sign.  
And then you laugh. Because you know it’s not.  
And then you don’t laugh. Because a part of you *wants* it to be.  
And that part never really dies.  

It just gets older.  
And more tired.  
And eats cold rice under pigeons.  

Sometimes I dream I’m a bird.  
Not flying. Just perched. Observing.  
A stupid avian deity with mild diarrhea and great luck.  
Some poor fuck tosses me chana and hopes I’ll fix his daughter’s uterus.  

And I shit. I shit with all the glory of prophecy.  
And they worship it.  
And I preen.  
Because even pigeons need meaning.  

Last night, I made the mistake of jacking off to a memory of a woman who once bought me samosas during Cyclone Aila, and immediately afterward, the power went out. And I fucking *froze*. Like, what have I unleashed? Did my semen short-circuit the grid?  

I lit a candle. Not for light.  
Just in case she was watching.
