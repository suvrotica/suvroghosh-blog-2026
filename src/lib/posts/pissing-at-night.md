I wake the way a submarine wakes to a sonar ping—no dream, no poetry, just a clean internal alarm: a complaint has been filed, stamped URGENT, and escalated directly to the dictator in charge (which is not, despite my many books and my long practice of overthinking, “the mind”; it is a wet, muscular sack with the diplomacy of a traffic horn).

The room is dark in that particular Calcutta way—darkness with texture, with smells: old cotton, cheap phenyl, dust that has learned the architecture of my shelves; my feet hunt for the slipper like a blind man learning braille, and the whole body becomes a single purpose-built machine whose job is to transport a trembling cup of liquid from Point A to the nearest sanctioned hole. *Shauchalay*, we say when we want to be polite, as if the politeness does anything to the physics.

It is ridiculous, this sudden transformation from “I contain multitudes” to “I contain 300 millilitres and I’m taking it personally.” And it is, in a way that should be taught in schools as a corrective to spiritual branding, profoundly democratic: nobody’s ideology survives a full bladder. You can be a sage, a nationalist, an atheist, a godman, a TED-talk soufflé of optimism—none of it matters when the detrusor muscle (the thick wall of smooth muscle, which does not read essays) begins to squeeze and the sphincters begin to negotiate like tired bureaucrats.

That negotiation is the whole drama. Two valves, one mostly automatic (internal sphincter), one more under conscious control (external sphincter), and a control room in the brainstem—the pontine micturition center, a phrase so wonderfully pompous it sounds like a colonial club for urination, all brass spittoons and stiff upper streams. Signals go up and down the spinal cord; stretch receptors report, politely at first, then with rising hysteria; the cortex pretends it’s in charge until it isn’t. This is not “willpower.” This is a state machine with thresholds.

Age, of course, adds its own footnotes. Pipes stiffen, nerves misbehave, sleep becomes thin and perforated. In men, the prostate—once a quiet supporting actor—starts auditioning for the role of obstruction. The stream weakens, the urgency sharpens, the night fills with small humiliations. Biology has no sense of narrative dignity. It does not care that I once understood eigenvectors, that I once had an academic future, that I can pronounce “micturition” like a BBC presenter. It only cares about pressures and valves.

“Micturition,” by the way, is one of those words invented to keep bodily truth at arm’s length, like calling a street dog a “free-ranging urban canid.” We say “pee” when we want cuteness, “piss” when we want honesty, “urinate” when we want distance, and “mutra” (मूत्र) when we want the ancient authority of Sanskrit hovering over the situation like incense over a latrine. Bengali gives me “peshab,” a practical word with no romance, the sort of word a city uses when it has other problems to solve.

There’s an old temptation to turn all this into a morality play: you held it in, so you are disciplined; you couldn’t hold it, so you are weak; you wake at night, so you are decadent; you leak, so you are… what, exactly? A failure of character? This is where the culture does its little magic trick: it takes a mechanical issue and sells you shame as a premium add-on.

The same machinery that can’t teach a child what a neuron is will happily teach him that “control” is a spiritual virtue—preferably with a poster of a serene yogi who has apparently not urinated since the Gupta Empire. There are entire industries built around the fantasy that you can out-yoga your autonomic nervous system, as if the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches are waiting for your guru’s permission to behave. (They are not. They are busy running your heart, your gut, your sweating, your trembling, your small animal panic at 3:17 a.m.)

I almost drift into one of my familiar rants here—the pageantry of cleanliness campaigns, the photo-op brooms, the sanctimonious slogans painted on walls that still smell like open drains—but that’s a well-worn groove in my skull, and some internal editor flashes WARNING: RECURRENCE DETECTED. So I swerve, deliberately, like a man dodging a pothole he already knows by name.

Instead I think of it as municipal engineering. A reservoir with finite capacity, an inflow rate you do not control, a sensor array that becomes less reliable with age, and an overflow event society treats as a moral catastrophe. The pelvis is a small Kolkata in miniature—pipes, pressure, leakages, emergency shutoffs, and a management team that communicates by sending urgent memos to the brain at the worst possible times.

You can even do the math, if you’re the sort of person (I am) who tries to console himself with equations when confronted with embarrassment. Urgency behaves like a hazard function: the longer you wait past a certain volume, the risk of an accident rises sharply, not linearly. It’s not a gentle slope; it’s a cliff with a polite signboard at the top saying PLEASE DO NOT FALL. And sleep? Sleep is when the cortex is supposed to mute the noise. But in middle age the muting becomes sloppy, and the little bureaucrats discover they can call you at any hour and you will answer.

This is where the body is accidentally tender, in its own brutal way. It forces honesty. It collapses the grandiose self into a small creature in a dim room, shuffling across cold tile, trying not to wake the neighbors, trying not to slip, trying not to think too much about time. The sprint is humiliating, yes, but it is also proof that I still care about arriving intact. There’s a stubborn, unromantic desire to keep going that lives lower than philosophy.

And then the moment itself: the latch, the tiny click; the sound that is always more intimate than it should be; the warm arc hitting ceramic; the relief that is neither spiritual nor poetic but somehow feels like mercy anyway—pure negative feedback, pressure dropping, alarms silencing, the nervous system saying, fine, we won this round.

Outside, the city continues being itself: a distant horn, a stray cat conducting its private negotiations with garbage, a mosquito discovering my ankle like an explorer claiming land. Inside, a single drop misses the target and lands on the tile—small, bright, ridiculous—like a punctuation mark placed by a careless editor.

I wipe it up, with a scrap of paper I find lying around, the great philosopher and his favorite medium reduced to janitorial duties, and the universe remains unimpressed, which is one of its better qualities.
