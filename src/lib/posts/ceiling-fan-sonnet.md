<Dl>

I spy several cunts with steely-eyed hunts,

As I surf porn at near-light speed.

I can never tire; this orgasm dire,

Am I cumming; is this really my seed?

---

The ejaculate is dry; in a hoarse voice, I cry,

Fuck this world; I know for sure it's not my pie.

Simulation or not, an emotional knot,

I put a lie in my head and want to die.

---

Life a damp squib I quietly quip inside my rib,

Caged within a small cartoon Bengali torso.

Dick so small, the dull blunt man must fall,

Just a damp dank December depressive low.

---

Fuck it, I say, but I haven't shit today,

So I squat on the stool and crap.

Yes, Christmas cake—that's what I'll bake,

From this shit, some sugar, and wrap.

---

Misery is mine: mistletoe and wine,

What does a broke Bengali do in December?

He pisses in his bed, shits shit in mortal dread,

He's just more unhappy than any other head.

---

Yes, I think I will be more sad, lonely even,

I am, after all, a sad super lonely old man.

Doesn't matter what calendar date or weather,

I'm sad in a room with a ceiling fan.

---

It doesn't matter the pain, the vividness vain,

I am a sore little loser ninny bloody nincompoop.

I am a dingleberry doom that's duly done,

And soon will plop out of the fucking loop. 

---

Unceremoniously flushed then into a septic tank,

Like the fate meted out to all fetid feces fresh.

My atoms pain return to the soil again,

And the giggling universe hits a shit refresh.
