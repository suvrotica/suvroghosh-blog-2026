I kill several cunts with steely-eyed stunts,

As I surf porn at near-light speed.

I can never tire; this orgasm dire,

Am I cumming; is this really my seed?



The ejaculate is dry; in a hoarse voice, I cry,

Fuck this world; I know for sure it's a lie.

Simulation or not, an emotional knot,

I put a gun in my head and want to die.



Fuck it, I say, but I haven't shit today,

So I squat on the stool and crap.

Yes, Christmas cake—that's what I'll bake,

From this shit, some sugar, and wrap.



Misery is mine: mistletoe and wine,

What does a broke Bengali do in December?

He pisses in his bed, shits shit in mortal dread,

He's just more unhappy than any other head.



Yes, I think I will be more sad, lonely even,

I am, after all, a sad super lonely old man.

Doesn't matter what calendar date or weather,

I'm sad in a room with a ceiling fan.
