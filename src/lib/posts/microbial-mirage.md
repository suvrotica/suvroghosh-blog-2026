The cake arrives in a crinkled cardboard coffin, taped like evidence, and when I tear it open the first thing that hits me is not “Christmas” so much as *a chemical approximation of joy*—vanillin (the budget cousin of vanilla), a smack of rum essence that never met a barrel, and that sweet, slightly metallic fog that hangs around anything with too much glycerin and too little shame.

The icing has the texture of wall putty left out in a Calcutta winter—soft, reluctant, vaguely damp—while the inside is studded with fluorescent “fruit” that looks like it escaped from a cheap aquarium: green cubes, red slivers, orange bits, all of them suspiciously immortal. I hold a slice near the tube-light, as one does when one has an underfunded scientific temperament, and I can almost see the economics: an artisanal cake, yes, handcrafted, yes, lovingly, yes—by which we mean a woman in a back room with a hairnet in theory, a mixing bowl in practice, and the municipal water supply as a kind of philosophical question.

Outside, the city is doing its annual theatre. A little tinsel, a little Mariah, a little Santa-in-sweat. People stroll Park Street and behave as if looking festive is the same thing as being alive, as if a photograph with a paper crown can substitute for whatever it is we keep failing to nurture the other eleven months. Somewhere a loudspeaker is murdering “Jingle Bells” with the persistence of a bureaucrat stamping forms. Somewhere someone has decided that the correct proof of cheer is to buy a cake big enough to require structural engineering.

And the cake, the cake is the highlight—*the* highlight—of Christmas in this city that otherwise specializes in long, slow disappointment, because it’s portable celebration. You can carry it home. You can show it to relatives. You can slice it into social legitimacy.

It is also, I suspect, a microbiological crime scene.

# The Great Calcutta Cake Mirage

Calcutta loves a symbol. The city is a museum of symbols that have outlived their contents—columns without empires, statues without conviction, slogans without comprehension. So the Christmas cake becomes a kind of edible emblem: proof that you participated, proof that you belong, proof that you were modern for a moment, proof that your household contains “culture” (which, in Indian English, often means *purchased things that suggest you are not desperate*).

The irony is that the real labour of that cake—the deep work, the alchemy, the transformation from wet flour-sadness to something fragrant and structured—was not performed by any saint, chef, grandmother, influencer, or church committee.

It was performed by small beings.

Not small in the sentimental way we say “small” when we mean “cute,” but small in the brutal, accurate way we mean when we talk about bacteria and yeasts and moulds—organisms that don’t care about your surname, your flag, your caste certificate, your religion, your nationalist tantrums, your carefully curated nonsense. They have no ethnicity. They have no country. They don’t even have the courtesy to be visible.

They just metabolize.

And yet we insist on turning the cake into an identity performance. We talk about “our tradition,” “our heritage,” “authentic plum cake,” “secret family recipe,” as if the universe is waiting breathlessly to know whether you used cashews or almonds. Meanwhile, the actual workers—the ones producing carbon dioxide bubbles to lift dough, the ones generating ethanol and esters that smell like warmth, the ones acidifying batter to keep pathogens at bay—continue their quiet labour without credit, without ceremony, without Instagram.

We praise the box. We ignore the factory.

# Fermentation: The Unseen Republic

There is a word that behaves like a tiny documentary: *fermentation*. It comes from Latin *fervere*, “to boil,” because to ancient eyes a fermenting vat looked like it was alive—bubbling, seething, exhaling. Which was correct, except the life doing the boiling was not divine inspiration but microbial respiration and chemical kinetics.

The star of this show is often **Saccharomyces cerevisiae**—a yeast whose name is basically a résumé: “sugar-fungus of beer.” Give it sugar, warmth, a little water, and it does what it has been doing for longer than our moral panics have been fashionable: it eats glucose and produces ethanol and carbon dioxide, plus a bouquet of side-products—esters, aldehydes, higher alcohols—that make bread smell like bread and not like damp cardboard.

CO₂ inflates dough like a soft political lie: airy, persuasive, structurally essential. Ethanol mostly evaporates in baking, but it leaves behind flavour and, more importantly, proof that something genuinely transformed. This is the part people forget: fermentation is not decoration. It is a *phase change* in reality. Before fermentation, you have ingredients. After fermentation, you have an emergent thing with new properties—texture, aroma, digestibility, shelf life.

In a sense, fermentation is the most honest kind of “community work” because it is literally many small agents following local rules and producing a coherent global structure. No committee. No slogans. No “we are proud to announce.” Just distributed labour and a loaf at the end.

And the microbes don’t ask to be thanked. They don’t even know you exist. Which is, frankly, refreshing.

# “Plum Cake” and Other Lies We Eat Happily

Calcutta’s Christmas cake is often called “plum cake,” which is charming, because it usually contains no plums. The “plum” is a historical dodge: a nineteenth-century habit of calling raisins and currants “plums” in certain English-speaking contexts, a linguistic fossil that wandered into colonial kitchens and never left. So we keep saying “plum cake” the way we keep saying “dial” a phone or “tape” a recording—words surviving as ghosts of old technology.

There’s another lie embedded in the modern artisanal economy: “handmade” is treated like a synonym for “safe” and “pure,” when it frequently means “unregulated” and “done in a room where the local fauna has voting rights.” I don’t say this as a snob; I say this as someone who has lived long enough in South Calcutta’s boondocks to understand that hygiene here is often an *aspiration* rather than a condition. We talk about purity obsessively—ritual purity, dietary purity, national purity—yet the kitchen counter is a damp democracy of crumbs, fingers, flies, and existential resignation.

The cake becomes the festive highlight precisely because it is a ready-made miracle. You don’t see the process. You see the finished object. It arrives like a gift from “tradition,” which is just marketing with ancestors.

But process is where the real world hides.

Bread is flour plus water plus time plus microbes. Beer is grain plus water plus microbes plus patience. Many liquors are sugar sources plus microbes plus distillation (which is another kind of selective honesty: you take the chaotic fermented soup and concentrate its intoxicating signal). Indian dishes that we treat as “just cooking” are often microbial collaborations in disguise: batter for **idli** and **dosa** turned airy and tangy by lactic acid bacteria and yeasts; **dahi** set by *Lactobacillus* and friends; pickles that survive because salt and acid create a microbial bouncer at the door; **kanji** that tastes like winter sunlight filtered through bacteria.

Even the things we call “fresh” are often ancient microbial arrangements. Your gut is an ecosystem. Your skin is a landscape. Your food is a temporary parliament of organisms negotiating conditions.

And then we have the audacity to plaster all this with religion and nationalism, as if the yeast is checking your voter ID.

# A Sanskrit Line I Don’t Believe In (But I Understand)

I am an atheist, which in India means I am either “confused,” “angry,” or “Westernized,” like skepticism is a foreign import that arrived with the railways. But there are old lines that still land—not as revelation, but as anthropology, as the kind of accidental wisdom a civilization sometimes stumbles into.

अन्नाद्भवन्ति भूतानि  
(*annād bhavanti bhūtāni*)

“From food, beings arise.”

It’s from the *Bhagavad Gita*, and I don’t take it as cosmic truth, but as a neat observation: food is not just fuel; it’s infrastructure. It’s chemistry that becomes society. It’s agriculture that becomes politics. It’s fermentation that becomes ritual.

What the verse doesn’t say—but what my cake slice is screaming—is that *from microbes, food arises*. Or at least, from microbes, food becomes tolerable, tasty, safe, storable, celebratable. The smallest beings do the biggest civilizing work. They domesticated us as much as we domesticated them.

We didn’t invent bread so much as we learned how to host yeast.

# The Great Festive Bullshit Overlay

<Yt src="https://youtu.be/0XzU_q_DyDw?si=uit3M_J6oTANQvRk" />

Here’s the part where I as an iconoclastic misanthrope become unbearable, so let me at least be accurate while doing it. Every Christmas in Calcutta is a strange colonial hangover, soaked in rum cake and indigestion. The city decks itself in fairy lights and fake snow, but the stomachs beneath those sweaters are brewing full-blown gastric revolts. People gorge on plum cake thick with dried fruits soaked in cheap alcohol, roast meats their intestines haven’t seen all year, and sugary drinks disguised as festive cheer. Hospitals quietly prepare for the annual uptick in emergency admissions—hypertensive crises, sudden spikes in diabetes, gallbladder tantrums—because when Christ is born, Calcutta eats like it’s the Last Supper. Add to that the celebratory tippling—wine for some, whiskey for most—and the night ends with a predictable spike in drunk driving, sirens replacing carols. Then there’s the trash: heaps of wrapping paper, broken baubles, plastic Santas with amputated limbs, all dumped unceremoniously by morning. Park Street glitters, but behind the shimmer is the slow constipation of a city hoarding its own debris—joy, yes, but also cholesterol, chaos, and crap.

Perhaps like the rest I should be festive and cheery, but I can't seem to enjoy the shot glass of way too short-term thinking—this compulsion to gorge, to light things up, to pretend for one blurry night that none of it matters. The debts don’t disappear with tinsel. The loneliness doesn’t shrink with fairy lights. And the planet certainly doesn’t sigh in relief because someone wore a Santa hat and ate six plum cakes. There’s something obscene about celebrating in a city that’s already choking—on its own noise, on plastic-wrapped consumer joy, on the rising bile of comorbid middle age. I step outside and see the streets littered with the aftermath of cheer: broken ornaments, empty liquor bottles, kids vomiting sugar, grown men urinating behind church walls. And I wonder, not bitterly but wearily, if the real miracle of Christmas is how neatly we’ve managed to gift-wrap our collective decay in tinfoil and call it tradition.
 
Christmas in Calcutta—like many imported festivals—has been metabolized into a consumer ritual. It is less about theology than about aesthetics: lights, cake, music, shopping, the intoxicating permission to be briefly theatrical. The city doesn’t need Jesus to enjoy a party; it needs an excuse. The excuse changes; the impulse stays.

The cake functions as a secular sacrament. It’s shared. It’s sliced. It’s offered. It’s photographed. It’s used to mark time: *this is the week we pretend things are okay*.

But the cake’s real miracle is not the season. It is fermentation. It is the fact that little organisms, indifferent and unbribable, did their job.

Which makes our overlay of identity—the “my festival,” “your festival,” “our culture,” “their culture”—look even more absurd. Because the underlying engine of celebration is universal biochemistry. Yeast doesn’t hate. Lactobacillus doesn’t discriminate. They do not form mobs. They do not demand loyalty. They do not write bad poetry about the nation.

They just convert substrates.

It’s embarrassing, really, how much moral drama we drape over processes that are, at root, thermodynamics with personality.

And, yes, I am aware of the irony: I am sitting here moralizing over a cake while the world burns in much more consequential ways. But this is how the mind works when it has read too many books and lived too many disappointments—it takes a small thing and uses it as a portal to the whole damned system.

# A Private Experiment, A Quiet Rebellion

Somewhere between my resentment and my tenderness, I do a small, almost comical act of defiance: I stop buying the festive miracle and start courting the process.

Not heroically. Not in a “back to the roots” performance. Just privately, like a man trying to regain a little agency in a life that often feels like it is being managed by external forces—family expectations, economic gravity, city chaos, the relentless noise of other people’s certainty.

I take a jar. Warm water. A spoon of flour. A pinch of sugar. I add nothing sacred. I say no prayer. I cover it loosely, because microbes enjoy oxygen at the start, like shy guests arriving early.

And then I wait.

By morning there is a faint tang. By evening a few bubbles. By the next day a living smell—something between green apples and damp grain and promise. I am not “making” anything in the grand human sense. I am creating conditions, and life shows up to do what life does.

It’s the closest thing I know to honest optimism: not belief in progress, not faith in humanity, but confidence that if you set the constraints correctly, small agents will coordinate into something coherent. A loaf. A batter. A drink. A meal. A moment of sweetness that doesn’t require a festival committee.

I look back at the purchased cake slice—its glossy icing, its immortal fruit, its air of manufactured nostalgia—and it suddenly feels like a metaphor for so much else: the finished object worshipped, the process ignored, the workers unseen, the branding loud, the truth quiet.

Outside, someone bursts fireworks in a damp lane, the sky flinches, and my little jar of yeast does not care.

It just keeps bubbling, like a tiny, indifferent laugh at all our festive bullshit.
