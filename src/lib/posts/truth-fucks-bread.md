I was watching Sharad Sharma—ex-NDTV, still somehow clinging to the suicidal idea that truth matters—sweating through a mic, reporting from some piss-yellow alley in Delhi where laborers were coughing blood and eating air while builders and babus raked in redevelopment bonuses and asthma ward kickbacks. And as this man, clearly not on payroll, tried to speak over the diesel hum of this slowly collapsing republic, all I could think about was how even he—sane, articulate, middle-aged, respectable—is just one unpaid invoice away from becoming another casualty of our great Indian kakistocracy, where the only thing that trickles down is unemployment and post-nasal drip. Because truth may still dare to speak, but in this country, joblessness foams at the mouth and bites indiscriminately—professors, plumbers, poets, PhDs, all sucked into the same gig economy hellhole where you either sell your spine or get eaten for having one.

Because let’s get this out of the way: the myth that only rickshaw-pulling, paan-spitting, one-lunged proletariat fucks are drowning in this economy? Horseshit. Everybody’s drowning. The middle class is just better at holding its breath and updating its LinkedIn while floating face down.

And no, it’s not just the saffron dipshits or that man-child in a muffler who sells hopium laced with Excel graphs and rented tears. Every fucking party in India, once in power, slips into that old caste-lubed rhythm of loot-fuck-hide, jizzing onto the Constitution with the glee of a coaching center lecturer who just sniffed his first parcel of black money. Doesn’t matter if they chant in Sanskrit, Arabic, or broken Hinglish—once they’re sworn in, your vote becomes a mosquito buzz they swat away with barricades and black SUVs.

I live in a cement fart of a room with one plastic chair that sounds like arthritis when I sit, a fridge that smells of onion murder, and a mind full of borrowed books I can't afford to read without spiraling into existential defecation. And still—*still*—some fucks on TV have the saggy tits to say we’re a rising superpower.

We’re not rising. We’re rotting upwards.

What we have is not democracy. It’s not even oligarchy. It’s *murgimocracy*—a coop where the loudest rooster gets beheaded and the others are too stupid to remember tomorrow. The elections are WWE scripts ghostwritten by Ambanis, and each new administration is a fresh strain of syphilis wearing a Nehru jacket or a Ram Mandir selfie on its forehead like a fucking QR code for fascism.

Meanwhile, on ground zero, every second household has a daughter who’s suicidal, a father who’s bankrupt, a mother peddling turmeric as cancer cure, and a brother worshipping Andrew Tate while failing competitive exams like it’s a family tradition. I’ve seen men with MTechs eat banana peels out of hotel trash piles in Ballygunge because their startups failed and their wives left with the last working fan.

But Satya Meva Jayate, right? Truth triumphs. Except in real life it doesn’t. In real life, truth’s a broke-ass whore who’s been fucked raw by too many slogans and now walks funny. Truth, my dear, smells like leaking sewer gas and sounds like the resignation letter of an honest civil servant being quietly shredded at 2AM while the PM records a yoga video.

There’s a special breed of Bengali intellectual who still thinks we can *debate* our way out of this, sipping watery coffee and stroking their limp Marxist egos while pretending the world gives a fuck about Tagore quotes. I used to be one. Now I just smell like feet and microwave mutton.

And science? Hah. Science in India is like that ancient condom in your wallet—there for moral support but never used. Every minister with half a liver and zero IQ now spews cow urine as vaccine, Vedas as astrophysics, and builds statues so tall they can’t hear the cries of hungry kids in the shadow below.

Meanwhile, I wait four hours for water because my building tank is filled once a week by a man who smells like diesel and failure, and during those hours I write these invisible thoughts on a phone that heats up like my scalp under this paralyzed fan. My pubes are sticky with sweat and irony.

You want a bodily metaphor?

Being Indian today is like having hemorrhoids on a public bus—you can’t scream, you can’t sit, and every bump on the road is a fresh insult to your dignity.

You want history?

Let’s talk about how we inherited not just railways and bureaucracy from our colonizers, but also their most exquisite gift: **the ability to repress dissent with dignity**, to lie with straight backs and folded hands. Our leaders don’t silence opposition with jackboots—they do it with legalese and WhatsApp leaks, press raids and Pegasus cock-in-ear spyware. We've made Orwell look like a naïve optimist.

And the common man? Ah, that poor dickless bastard. Fed a diet of mythology, revenge porn, cricket highlights, and job scams. Ganja is illegal but rapists get parades. An influencer can sell you protein powder for 3000 bucks, but your anemia test costs a month’s wage and still comes stamped with errors.

I once had an idea for a health tech startup. Built a full EHR prototype. Scalable, localized, resilient. You know what I got?

A mouthful of spit from investors asking if I could "make it AI so Modi ji can talk to villagers in Hindi."

I told them I could also make the app fart and sing bhajans while jacking off to GDP charts.

Didn’t go well.

Anyway, here I am, eating cold bread with onion salt because I’m too broke to buy eggs, too old to beg, too proud to sell my ass, and too jaded to hope.

Hope.

Hope is like that last fart you trust before a long walk—you think it’s safe but it stains.

And me?

I’m a 52-year-old bipolar Bengali with a mild crush on Sudhir Chaudhary’s mustache and a death wish for every municipal clerk who ever told my mother to come back "after lunch."

Last week I masturbated to a cooking video because the woman used mustard oil like a goddess and I hadn’t tasted mustard oil in a month.

The soul hungers in strange ways.

And now the bread's got mold.

But it’s democracy, so I eat it anyway. And the truth? It doesn't dance, it doesn't flirt, it doesn’t do Bollywood pelvic thrusts while waving tricolor condoms in the air. Truth does not the entertaining cut make. It drags, it itches, it mutters like an old man pissing in installments. My truth has that gritty, sandy, mouthful-of-ash texture, like the kind you taste after watching a Mrinal Sen film alone in the dark while your neighbour blasts Daler Mehndi next door. Or the kind Ray wrapped inside those quiet shots of rusted railings and hopeless eyes—no slow-mo hero, no punchline, just the slow rot of dignity. And like that, my posts—these disturbed, shit-slicked, cum-sour atheist spasms of bile—make the holy citizens of this chemically neutered republic flinch. Because nothing unsettles the faith-wanking majority more than someone who doesn’t kneel, doesn’t chant, doesn’t fake reverence, and still refuses to die quietly.
