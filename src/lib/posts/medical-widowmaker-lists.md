I had all my books and notes and paper assets moved from my North Calcutta flat to this godforsaken termite‑ridden South Calcutta prison, this sunbaked asbestos‑top shithole adjacent where I now live surrounded by mediocrity and motorbike exhaust—but in one of the damp trunks, nestled between a bound set of *Prabasi* issues and my old B.Sc practical record where I’d drawn an amoeba like it had jaundice, I found it—

wedged inside a yellowed envelope that reeked of Dettol and piss—my father’s diary, or more accurately, his medical panic ledger, a fucking Rolodex of desperation, with one dried leaf from an old neem tree squashed inside like it too had tried and failed to cure him.

First page—lists.
Second page—lists.
Every page after that—fucking lists.

Not poems. Not dreams. Not a single “Dear diary, today I felt young again” or even “the nurse had nice ankles.”
Just names.
Doctor names.
Specialties.
Chamber addresses.
Timings that were theoretical, aspirational, almost literary.
Phone numbers scratched out and rewritten like regret.
Blood pressure readings like falling share prices.
“Doxy 200 morning—PPI—NO MILK.”
Underline.
Circle.
Two exclamation marks like the pills would grow legs and chase him if he forgot.

He had—Jesus fuck—built his own electronic health record with a ballpoint pen on ruled paper. A tragic, coffee‑stained, tear‑salted EHR, a shrine to compliance. He believed in medicine the way accountants believe in ledgers. Because in his mind, and in the minds of every educated, colonially trimmed, exam‑passing middle‑class Indian bastard of his generation, *doctor = God*.

Except this God doesn’t wash his hands after fingering your lungs.

He didn’t die of a disease.
He died of a system.
Pneumonia my ass.
He was killed by an algorithm of apathy—a slow, bureaucratic, antiseptic‑smelling manslaughter involving forms, bedpans, and a rotating cast of men in white coats who never once read what the last guy wrote.

Hospital‑acquired resistant infection.
Which is scientific code for: we fed him to the bugs we’ve been cultivating for decades like prized fucking orchids.

Because here’s the part nobody likes to say out loud while they’re busy touching foreheads and chanting *get well soon*—Indians are marinated in antibiotics from childhood. We grow up chewing amoxicillin like orange candy, Ofloxacin like Hajmola, Azithromycin like fucking after‑dinner mints. Every sore throat, every loose motion, every “maybe viral but let’s be safe” gets nuked with something broad‑spectrum and dumb, and nobody—*nobody*—checks resistance. Not then. Not later. Not until the lungs are soup and the catheter site looks like a crime scene.

Doctors don’t test because tests cost time and thinking, and thinking doesn’t bill well. So they keep throwing pills at you like a drunk gambler chasing losses, and by the time someone finally whispers “maybe culture?” it’s already too late, because the bacteria have PhDs now and your immune system is a tired clerk who’s been working overtime since 1982.

And then you go into an Indian hospital while vulnerable, while already cracked open by illness, and your chances of picking up multiple resistant infections multiply like compound interest, because the place is a free buffet floating in the air and the water and the fucking bedrails. You breathe there—you get infected. You drink tea from a plastic cup—you get infected. You piss in a toilet with a leaky flush—you get infected. The stethoscope touching your chest hasn’t been cleaned since Manmohan Singh had hair. Hospitals here are Petri dishes with billing software, five‑star slaughterhouses where the meat pays up front and still dies politely.

The bugs that killed him even had fancy names. *Acinetobacter baumannii*. *Klebsiella pneumoniae*. Sounds like Italian philosophers. Sounds like pasta. And these charming cunts evolved happily in damp corners and old tubing while our MBBS brigade, who memorized Guyton like scripture but forgot the word hygiene, kept scribbling Cipro and hoping for the best.

Nobody reads journals. Nobody updates. Medicine here is a performance art—a kabuki of concern where you frown, tap a pen, say “let’s observe for 48 hours,” and charge 1500 rupees for the privilege of being ignored. Patients are a human ATM queue. Diagnostics get milked. Referrals get stacked. When the cow stops mooing, you say *admit korle bhalo hobe* and move on.

My father didn’t admit. He submitted.

He submitted to a machinery where the human being is incidental, the file is sacred, and continuity of care is a myth told to calm relatives. He asked—not dramatically, just with that quiet Bengali resignation—for someone to read what the last doctor had written. They didn’t. They never do.

In the end, a respiratory consultant didn’t even check his oxygen properly because the pulse oximeter was broken and the junior thought 85 percent was “okay for his age.”

Eighty‑five percent.
That’s not oxygenation.
That’s Russian roulette with a silencer.

And still the diary stayed in his bag like a loyal, stupid dog. Pages of hope. Of follow‑ups that never followed up. He’d written “DR. CHAKRABORTY—PULMO—ASK ABOUT VACCINE” weeks before the infection. Chakraborty said they didn’t have it and it wasn’t necessary for “stable patients.”

Stable.
Stable!
He had one working lung and a stack of X‑rays thicker than my childhood photo album.

Nobody cared. Not really. Not in this decaying, GDP‑wanking country where public health is a punchline and private hospitals are mafias with parking lots. You’re not a man when you walk into a clinic here. You’re a walking EMI.

They let him rot. Quietly. Efficiently. With receipts.

Negligence here is so normalized it’s practically spiritual.

And the cruel joke is his generation still believes in the sanctity of the profession. They still wear socks to appointments. Still say Doctor Babu. Still die clutching lists like paper talismans.

I keep the diary in a box now. Not for memories. For the lists. Because one day, when it’s my turn to cough blood and shit mucus and some app promises “AI‑powered care,” I’ll open it and read:

“DR. Something Something (RETIRED)—charges too high—hands shaky—still maybe okay for second opinion?”

That’s as good as it gets.

Today I woke up with acid in my throat and three missed calls from my mother asking if I’ve booked my colonoscopy yet. I told her soon. Then I farted, checked the PM2.5—221—and thought how the air is still safer for bacteria than it is for me.
