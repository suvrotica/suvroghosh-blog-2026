I had all my books and notes and paper assets moved from my North Calcutta flat to this godforsaken termite-ridden South Calcutta prison, this sunbaked asbestos-top shithole where I now live surrounded by marriage halls and motorbike exhaust and distant aunties screaming “*ei tui shoshur ke ki bolish?*” like it’s Shakespeare in the fucking park—but in one of the damp trunks, nestled between a bound set of Prabasi issues and my old B.Sc practical record where I’d drawn an amoeba like it had jaundice, I found it—

wedged inside a yellowed envelope that reeked of Dettol and piss—my father’s diary, or more accurately, his medical panic ledger, a fucking Rolodex of desperation, with one dried leaf from an old neem tree squashed inside like it too had tried and failed to cure him.

First page—lists.
Second page—lists.
Every page after that—fucking lists.

Not poems. Not dreams. Not a single “Dear diary, I touched her elbow and felt the stirrings of youth”—nope.
Just…
Doctor names.
Doctor specialties.
Chamber addresses.
Chamber timings (which of course, those bastards never followed).
Phone numbers—half scratched out, updated, revised, re-corrected, corrected corrections.
Blood pressure readings like stock market crash tickers.
“Doxy 200 morning—PPI—NO MILK.”
Underline.
Bold.
Two exclamation marks like the pills would come alive and shoot you if you forgot.

He had—Jesus fucking Christ—compiled his own EHR manually on *ruled paper*. And what a heartbreaking, crusty, dog-eared EHR it was. One with coffee stains, tears, red scribbles that looked like murder notes. The poor motherfucker had believed in medicine more than priests believe in tithes. Because in his mind, and in the minds of every educated-but-colonially-clipped middle-class Indian bastard who survived the License Raj, *doctor = God*.

Except this God forgets to wash his hands after fingering your lungs.

He didn’t die from a disease.
He died from a *system*.
Pneumonia my ass.
He was killed by an algorithm of apathy—a slow-motion, multi-hospital, antiseptic-oozing, bedpan-clanking manslaughter.

Hospital-acquired resistant infection.
Which is scientific code for “we didn’t change the fucking sheets and kept stabbing him with the same IV catheter like we were playing pin-the-tail-on-the-grumpy-old-Bengali.”

You ever try explaining “nosocomial” to someone who thinks cough syrup cures COVID?
Or that *resistance* isn't just some metaphorical uprising against the British Raj of bacteria, but a *literal* goddamn gene-switch flipping in a petri dish, saying “fuck you” to antibiotics while your dad chokes in low-flow oxygen in a 15-bed ward shared with three patients and one nurse scrolling WhatsApp?

Every doctor he ever saw—and he saw *dozens*—was a credentialed executioner with an expensive stethoscope and a 9-year-old understanding of microbiology.
Some had notes. Some had suits. Some had white hair and a God complex.
None had shame.

And they all kept prescribing azithromycin like it was fucking candy at a Durga Puja stall.
“Let’s try this,” they’d mutter with the intellectual rigor of a coked-up mechanic poking at a rattling engine with a screwdriver.
No cultures.
No antibiograms.
No cross-checking his meds.
Just vibes and fucking brand names.

You know what's really funny?
The resistant bacteria that killed him—*they* had names too.
Acinetobacter baumannii.
Klebsiella pneumoniae.
Sounds like posh Italian poets.
Sounds like designer fucking pasta shapes.

And these charming cunts evolved in the cracks of hospital tiles and the backwash of old IV tubing while our Indian MBBS-brigade, who memorized Guyton like gospel but forgot the word “hygiene,” scribbled Cipro and hoped for the best.

Because nobody here reads medical journals.
Nobody here *learns*.
Medicine is a performance—an expensive, sterile kabuki where you wear a coat and frown and say “let’s observe for 48 hours” while charging 1500 rupees for the consultation and making aunties remove their blouses so you can poke a stethoscope into their mortality.

Meanwhile, your patient list is a *human ATM queue*, each body slotting into the bed, getting milked for diagnostics—thyroid panels, X-rays, unnecessary MRIs because the center has a profit target to meet—and when the cow stops mooing, you send them off with “admit korle bhalo hobe.”

My father didn’t *admit*. He submitted.

He submitted to a machinery where the human being is the symptom, the file is the patient, and the cure is always another referral.
He begged—not dramatically, but with that quiet helplessness Bengali men reserve for bill counters and medical forms—for *continuity*, for sense, for *somebody* to read what the last guy had written.
They didn’t.

In the end, he was being seen by a respiratory consultant who didn’t even check his saturation levels properly because the pulse oximeter was fucking broken, and the junior doctor thought 85% was “okay” for someone his age.

Eighty-five percent.
That’s not oxygenation.
That’s Russian roulette with a silencer.

And still—still—his little diary sat there in his bag like a loyal fucking labrador.
Pages upon pages of hope, of scheduling, of follow-ups that never followed up.
He wrote “DR. CHAKRABORTY—PULMO—ASK ABOUT VACCINE” two weeks before he got infected.
Guess what Chakraborty said?
“We don’t have that here, and anyway it’s not necessary for stable patients.”

Stable.
Stable!
He was a dying man with one functioning lung and a pile of chest X-rays thicker than my childhood photo album.

But nobody *cares*, not in this tattered, decaying, GDP-wanking, coal-smoke nation where public health is a joke and private hospitals are mafia dens with parking lots.

You’re not a man when you go to a doctor here.
You’re a walking EMI.

They let him rot.
Not dramatically.
Not with cruelty.
Just quietly.
Through forgetting, skipping, half-assing, misreading.

Negligence here is so normalized it’s practically spiritual.

And the irony?
His generation still believes in the sanctity of the medical *profession*.
Still wears socks to the clinic.
Still calls them “Doctor Babu” like they're about to fucking knight him with a sphygmomanometer.

And they still die.
Still carry lists like paper talismans.
Still hope.
Still pay.

Sometimes I wonder what infection is still living inside his old bedsheet, folded neatly by my mother like it was *clean*, like it didn’t see the worst.

I keep his diary in a box now.
Not for the memories.
For the lists.
Because one day, when it’s my turn to start coughing blood and shitting mucus and everyone’s busy installing health apps and debating whether to switch from Practo to some new ChatGPT-for-healthcare bullshit that pretends to give a fuck about empathy, I’ll open that diary and read:

“DR. SHANKAR RAY (RETIRED) — charges too high — hands shaky — still maybe okay for 2nd opinion?”

That’s as good as it gets.
