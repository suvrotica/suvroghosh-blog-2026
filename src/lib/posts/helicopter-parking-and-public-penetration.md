There’s a very particular way your asshole flinches when someone’s flaccid, probably fungal-damp crotch presses up against it in a bus queue near Esplanade, not maliciously, not erotically, just a tragicomic inevitability—like pigeon shit on Gandhi’s head or WhatsApp forwards about turmeric curing brain tumors—some things just are, and your sphincter learns early to cope by disassociating like a Victorian ghost child.

You can’t walk five feet in this cuntscaped country without grazing some stranger’s tit, cock, or groin sweat—and not in the charming French “ah pardon, madame” way but in the moist, bovine, jammed-like-rusting-luggage-racks, Bengal-station-platform way where the density of human meat per square meter is so high it might as well be a protein slurry.

You learn to breathe like a Buddhist monk in a bukkake video—slow, focused, pretending the river of piss isn’t rising around your ankles.

Parking lots?

Don't make me fucking laugh.

We don’t *have* parking lots.

We have disorganized collections of despair arranged around concrete tumors called malls, each with approximately six legal parking spots, two of which are always blocked by chai-wallahs or a constipated Hyundai Santro that’s been abandoned mid-turn like its owner just gave up on life between first and reverse.

The remaining four are claimed by oily, vest-wearing thugs who will physically insert your Maruti’s bumper inside another car’s vagina and then smile at you like you should thank them for this automotive gang bang.

Getting your car out of these fuck pits?

You have two options.

A) Spend thirty-nine minutes executing a twelve-point turn that requires three parking valets, one epileptic beggar, a stray dog, and a man in a lung-infected cough spiral to coordinate like Cirque du Soleil performers trying to avoid fucking each other mid-air.

B) Bring in a fucking *helicopter*.

A *chopper*, no joke, like you’re evacuating a prime minister from a flood zone.

Because in India, we don’t park.

We entomb.

We *inter* our cars like Pharaonic curses in reverse—piled under layers of dented Altos and old Ambassadors and Uber Prados in a goddamn sedimentary diagram of economic stagnation and vehicular impotency.

And then some unclefucker with an MBA from Pune will tell you that “India is developing, bhai!”

Developing into what?

A hentai orgy of accidental crotch contacts and involuntary fart inhalation?

You can’t even stand in a queue here without being physiologically violated.

Oh and "queue" is a Western colonial imposition like trousers or female literacy—we don’t *queue*, we gather.

We *press*.

We glom.

We *molest* each other gently with the desperation of lice fleeing shampoo.

You’ve not truly understood what it means to *exist* as a meatbag until the curve of your lower spine intimately knows the contour of a stranger’s semi-aroused belly under his shirt that smells of half-digested paratha and failed masculinity.

And then your turn comes and the man behind you exhales on your neck like a buffalo in heat and you remember, with terrifying clarity, that you are a body.

A warm, damp, leaking body in a nation of other leaking bodies.

And this isn’t a metaphor.

This is morning.

This is *life*.

Try taking a leak at Howrah station, you’ll see ten men pissing shoulder to shoulder like it’s a fucking synchronised swimming event and you, unlucky twat that you are, have to aim your sad wrinkled fuck-pipe into a urinal still steaming from ten previous dicks.

And god help you if you hesitate.

They’ll push.

Literally push your ass in with their pelvis like it’s wartime and they’re storming Normandy with their dicks out.

Don't talk to me about consent.

India fucked consent with a ladle, boiled it into dal, and served it on banana leaves with a side of your dignity.

Let’s not even start on traffic.

You can *feel* cars fucking each other.

Every red light is a tantric orgy of honks and exhausts and tiny polite suicides happening inside every Ola driver's soul.

I once saw a man park his car by reversing into a cow.

Not *around*.

*Into*.

The cow didn’t even moo.

It just looked at him with an expression of bovine pity that said: “Bro, I’ve given up shitting voluntarily since 2013 and *I* think you’re pathetic.”

And don’t think the metro saves you.

The Kolkata Metro is just a moving rape fantasy for people with cheap perfume and unresolved psychosexual trauma from convent school.

The “ladies section” is one tissue-width away from the “non-ladies section” and if you're short enough (hello, women and teenage boys) you’ll find your face buried in a stranger’s damp shirt pocket before you hit Chandni Chowk.

Now—somewhere between the third sweaty elbow in your rib and the fourteenth sour armpit you’ve sniffed like a connoisseur of despair—you’ll try to remember who you were.

You were a child once.

With a dream.

You read Sagan and masturbated to possibilities.

You wanted to be something.

Not a passenger in a nationwide human jigsaw puzzle where everyone's crotch is a puzzle piece and you’re the last unfortunate socket.

But dreams don’t survive the pressure of mass.

Not here.

Not when entropy wears flip-flops and keeps adjusting his balls behind you in line.

Even if you *wanted* to escape—say take a fucking *walk*—you’d be bouncing off chappal-wearing gropers who think brushing their scrotum against your jeans is a legitimate navigational technique.

And so you give in.

You clench.

You flex the emotional sphincter.

You accept that your body is public infrastructure.

And your personal space?

Is a Western luxury like air-fried kale or honest politicians.

Because here?

Here we helicopter our fucking cars and dry hump each other in queues to buy mobile recharges.

Here we breathe in the sweat of the nation and pretend it’s rain.

Here we are moist.

We are pressed.

We are never, ever, alone.
