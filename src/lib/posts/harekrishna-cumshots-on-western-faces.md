There’s a specific, oily type of rash you get when your boxer shorts are too tight, your balls are sweating through monsoon moisture, and you made the life-altering mistake of attending one of those Iskcon fuckfests on Park Street where the air smells like burnt cow shit and expired ghee smeared on the necks of poor German tourists who thought they were attending a mindfulness workshop but instead got spiritually face-fucked by a 300-pound Bengali fraud with two teeth, chanting “Govindaaaaa” while making eye contact that could sterilize mice.

That rash, that fungal red arc—part eczema, part spiritual regret—begins under the curve of the thigh and ends just at the upper asshole. It's a Krishna’s Kiss, and if you’ve never had it, you’ve never danced for four hours in your sweat-stained college tee while some overcooked sadhu in white bedsheets screams about nectar and the eternal dick of the universe.

Let’s get this out of the way: the Hare Krishna motherfuckers are culty as wet bread and almost as useful. They’re not the worst, but they sure as shit aren’t the best, unless your idea of spiritual enlightenment involves dressing like a 1970s air-hostess caught in a Hindu cosplay, handing out stale ladoos and unsolicited fucking pamphlets while ambushing you at traffic lights like saffron-tinted Jehovah’s Witnesses with harmoniums and halitosis.

I was nineteen when I first saw it. Not the rash—though that came later—but the spectacle. The performative piety, the bouncing white tits and dreadlocked white dicks jumping in beatific ignorance while one Krishna-fucker waved incense like he was casting a spell to summon his lost foreskin. They were white. So painfully white. So vegan, so yoga-mat-carrying, so spiritually desperate they would’ve licked a pujari’s toe-jam if he told them it came from Vishnu’s bunion. They said “Namaste” like it had an umlaut. Their Sanskrit pronunciation sounded like they’d gargled linoleum.

And they came. Came in droves. Came in Birkenstocks. Came with shitty tattoos of Om on their scapulas and came thinking India was some ancient hot tub of enlightenment, instead of a crumbling constipation of caste violence and men who scratch their balls in public with the same fingers they use to serve you prasad.

Do you know how many white people I’ve seen fall for it? It’s like watching Labradors walk into glass doors. They sit, legs crossed like they’re trying to hide a semi, nodding earnestly while some bald Bengali cunt with turmeric teeth reads a 4000-year-old instruction manual on social control, gender hierarchy, and ritualized food poisoning—and they say, “Wow, that’s *so deep.*” Bitch, it’s a fucking caste manual.

But we’re suckers too. We sell it.

Export the cow. Export the chant. Export the dull-ass philosophy stripped of all its genocidal nuance and call it peace.

Export saffron. Import white guilt.

Slap a bindi on it. Trademark it. And then market it to the white world like it’s a tantric blowjob that’ll help them orgasm into cosmic clarity instead of, you know, confronting their daddy issues and microdosing their way through burnout.

I once saw a white chick from Sweden—blue eyes, looked like she came out of a Glacier’s vagina—wearing a fucking dhoti. Not a sari. Not a kurta. A dhoti. Badly wrapped, with one tit half-hanging out like it was being slowly strangled by polyester, singing “Radhe Radhe” with the pure innocence of a sheep heading for halal. And the fucker next to her? A bald Finnish cuck with beads and a boner, whispering some bullshit about “cosmic semen” and the metaphysics of abstinence while clearly trying to edge himself under the robe.

These aren’t exaggerations. These are Tuesday mornings in Mayapur.

It always starts with food. The goddamn khichdi is the gateway drug. You’re hungover, your stomach’s grumbling like a menstruating goat, and some smiling HareKrishna twat hands you a paper plate full of ghee-drenched vegetarian sludge while saying, “This is prasadam—it’s blessed by Krishna himself!” And your dumb, underfed body eats it, gulps it down like it’s the milk of knowledge when it’s really just diarrhea foreplay with a side of lentil gas.

Next thing you know you’re chanting.

Then you’re dressing up.

Then you’re celibate.

Then your parents back in Ohio are crying on Zoom.

And the Bengali bastard who roped you in? He’s counting donation rupees with one hand while fondling his balls with the other, thanking Vishnu that white guilt and yoga class trauma are still the most renewable fucking resources on this planet.

Let’s talk about the science for a second—not because it matters, but because I need a breather before I explode a hemorrhoid. Dopaminergic cycles, parasympathetic relaxation, mantra-induced cortical deactivation—sure, yeah, there’s *something* happening in your brain when you go “Hare Hare Rama Rama” for forty fucking minutes while starving on a soy-only diet. But you know what else activates those same circuits? Jerking off. Crying into your ex’s old hoodie. Doing meth in a Walmart parking lot.

But no—somehow, chanting in Sanskrit makes you holy.

Sanskrit, the fucking colonial trophy language dragged into modernity by Brahmin fucklords and Orientalist jackoffs who thought it sounded fancy. Let’s not pretend it’s magic. It’s just old. Like herpes.

Meanwhile, every single brown cunt like me who grew up here knows exactly what these temples are: real estate scams with drum circles. And the white folks? They’re the customers. They pay in tears and tourist dollars, and we serve up Krishna like spiritual cocaine, hand-cut with mythology and moral blackmail, sniffed through the anus of white savior complex.

And what’s left?

Nothing but shaved heads, bellies full of lentils, and closets full of unused saffron robes next to yoga mats that now smell like crotch fungus and poor decisions.

I walked out of a temple last year, after pretending to care for thirty minutes, and saw a guy jacking off behind a dosa stall. Just casually. Like Krishna had blessed his right hand. The irony was that he was probably the only one honest in the whole fucking place.

I get it. I do. I want it too, sometimes. The belief. The submission. The idea that someone, anyone, has a fucking plan. But instead, I’ve got indigestion and suspicious groin itch, and the vague sense that everything sacred has been turned into a fucking merch store with incense.

And I still keep that ISKCON pamphlet. Not because I believe. But because it makes good toilet paper when you run out.

And I run out a lot.
