There was once a period in my life—I say period like it’s some fucking Gregorian calendar note and not a sticky, shame-glued loop of days where I jerked off every 4 hours and still felt like I’d stolen something from Jesus’s lunchbox—that I believed, genuinely, that sperm had a soul, and not in the stupid poetic way where people use words like “life essence” while lighting incense and weeping into their chakras, but like a courtroom drama where every ejaculation was a literal goddamn execution of millions of unborn choirboys.

And I didn’t make this shit up on my own. No, I had help.  
Good Christian help.

Which is weird because I was born Hindu, in a city that had more temples than toilets and yet somehow there it was—this leftover white-man guilt stashed between my legs like colonial herpes passed down through Latin textbooks and sweaty Jesuit lectures on how touching yourself turns you into a demon, or worse, a philosophy major.

The fucking irony.

They turned my foreskin into a confessional.

You don’t have to be circumcised to feel castrated, just raised under the slow fuckery of empire and middle-class education in 80s Calcutta, where masturbation was something boys didn’t talk about unless it was to accuse other boys of doing it because admitting it meant you were diseased or possessed or, hilariously, American.

Jesus Christ.

Even the word sounded like crime: MASTURBATION. The “mast” like BASTARD, the “tion” like CONDEMNATION—as if what you were doing in the dark with your Vaseline wasn’t relieving pressure but committing an act of spiritual genocide. And for what? A sticky belly and shame hiccups?

Let’s be fucking clear here—this guilt isn’t Vedic. Krishna had threesomes in the bushes and Shiva fucked corpses into transcendence. No, this—this rotten little voice whispering “you’re dirty, you’re sinful, that’s your grandmother’s photo on the wall”—that came later.

That came when the chucklefucks with powdered wigs and Bibles showed up with ships and syphilis and decided our dicks needed discipline.

You know who ruined sex? Not our gods. They were too busy fucking mountains.

It was the Christian missionaries—those grave-faced, ass-clenched penis police sent to save our souls but mostly to build schools that smelled like chalk and premature ejaculation, where they taught us grammar, shame, and the soft skill of sexual self-hatred in the same fucking sentence.

That’s when I knew.

This wasn’t about God. This was about power. The kind you embed not in sermons but in skin.

See, guilt is an exquisite technology. Better than guns, even. It doesn’t need ammo. Just repetition. You say the same thing long enough—“Don’t touch there.” “Don’t look.” “Don’t think about her thighs.” “Don’t think about your own goddamn thighs.” And it burrows.

It festers.

You don’t need chains when a voice lives inside your dick.

Even now, I can’t jerk off without feeling like a fucking war criminal who just bombed a village of angels because his balls were full.

And here’s the punchline, because every tragic fuck needs a rimshot:

India is now importing Western porn to jerk off to the same bodies we once feared because some pale-faced childless priest told us that semen was sacred and should only be deposited in holy pussy or at least married pussy—preferably missionary and for procreation—not because you needed to deflate the Godzilla-sized anxiety you carry in your balls because your salary is shit, your mother is sick, and the internet bill is late.

So now we jerk off with guilt and pray with porn and call that *progress.*

And don’t get me started on how Christian girls became the gold standard of erotic shame for brown boys like me—as if fucking a white girl was redemption and jerking off to one was atonement but doing either still meant you had somehow let down your culture, your parents, your caste, and Jesus all in one lotion-slick thrust.

Science break: the average male produces 1,500 sperm a second. That’s 129 million deaths per orgasm. If guilt had a math, I’d be the motherfucking Pol Pot of pleasure. But I need to jerk off before I sleep or otherwise I cum asleep, which is a real waste multidimensionally.

And I know. I *know* this shit isn’t exclusive to me. There are entire generations of desi boys who’ve spent their puberty in bathroom stalls with one hand on their dick and the other on a guilt-laced script written by colonial pricks who couldn’t get it up without punishing someone else.

It’s not just repression.

It’s a system.

It’s history in your hand and shame in your napkin.

Once I came to a photo of a woman in a saree ad cut from the Telegraph, and immediately felt like I’d pissed on the national flag.

She was holding a fucking mango.

I don’t even like that genre of mangoe cunts.

And that, my friend, is the genius of the Christian cunt legacy—they didn’t just demonize sex. They rewrote the neurons.

Now every erection comes with a memo from the Vatican and every orgasm is a tribunal.

And still, still I jerk off.

Why?

Because if there’s anything more resilient than guilt, it’s the human urge to fucking touch itself.

If you’re gonna burn in hell, you might as well finish first.
