The day I re-emerged from my personal fucking Mariana Trench—a sludgy, unwashed, self-loathing pit where I hadn't bathed in three days, possibly four (who’s counting when time is a cockroach that keeps resetting the damn clock every time you blink?)—the government, in its infinite gold-plated idiocy, was announcing the fucking *budget*, and I, a damp, damp-souled pseudo-corpse squatting like Gollum next to a rice cooker full of week-old khichdi, had the supreme misfortune of being lucid enough to hear the screeching chorus of excited budget analysts on YouTube. I hate all of them. Every single one of those happy, cheery, dickhole-faced economic parrots regurgitating bullshit with the smugness of a masturbating MBA on LinkedIn.

I didn’t even mean to listen. I just wanted to watch some ASMR of Korean ladies eating octopus to distract myself from the fact that my bedsheet smelled like fermented scrotum and I had no clean underwear that wasn’t already auditioning for a museum of tragic textile decay. But autoplay is a cruel mistress, and suddenly there it was: "Finance Minister’s Budget Speech LIVE!"—as if I give a rhinoceros’s arse about capital expenditure in the fiscal sense when I can’t afford Dettol for my crotch.

You see, I don’t own stocks. I own stains. Not equity. Patches of mold. 

I survive, and I say that loosely, on whatever micro-sum floats in from time to time—bits and bobs—people wanting writing, edits, ghost work, whispers of a life I had before this collapsed soggy cardboard version where even ambition has fungus. Sometimes I get ambitious enough to scrub my sink. It feels like applying for a visa to re-enter humanity. Denied.

And the depression—ah yes, that dirty black dog, or more precisely, a molasses-coated, blind, flatulent mastiff that sits directly on my chest and farts the scent of regret into my nostrils—that motherfucker had its paws wrapped tight around me for days. No sunrise, no joy, no memory of touch, just the echo of my own thoughts, pacing, pacing, pacing. You want to know what thoughts I had? Here: "If I die, how many days will it take before someone finds my corpse, and will they even believe I wasn’t already decomposing when I was alive?"

My bipolar isn’t the charming, artistic kind with paintings and poems and nude self-portraits in neon. Mine is an armpit in summer. It is piss-colored heat. It is the ache of bones asking why they’re still here. But like a wart you can’t afford to remove, I endure.

And just as I clawed my way up—perhaps spurred by the gut-twisting realization that I had not, in fact, drunk any water in 48 hours and my piss was beginning to resemble off-brand turmeric paste—I turned on the tap, washed my face with the dignity of a rat in a flood, and stumbled into the toxic daylight of budget day.

Now let’s talk about this performative shit-circus called a national budget. What the fuck is it? A formalized annual fart? A bureaucratic handjob in public? Because from where I sit, which is to say, in a plastic chair that’s cracking under the symbolic weight of Indian middle-class despair, none of this bloody matters. It’s all for the "markets," and who are they? People with shoes made of actual cow skin and not that fake Rexine trash I use as a door mat.

They speak of "agriculture allocations" while I haven’t seen a fruit in my kitchen since the banana that went blacker than my libido during monsoon. They talk of "AI infrastructure" and "digital India" while I, a once-something-now-nothing coder, literally fried a USB cable trying to plug my phone into a cracked wall socket.

It’s colonial hangover theatre. Whitehall cosplay. This entire economy is a foggy dick-dream of progress sold to 1.4 billion people with the promise of "growth" that feels suspiciously like a fungal infection—technically a growth, yes, but itchy, unpleasant, and slowly eating away your skin until the itch is all you are.

And they throw numbers around like it's goddamn cricket commentary. "Capital expenditure up by 17.3%." Oh, wow, Prem, tell me more while I try not to hallucinate rats speaking Sanskrit in my bathroom. The number could be up 300%, 1000%—doesn’t affect the way I will now have to reuse the same bar of soap for ass and armpit and possibly dishes.

I used to care. I used to believe that understanding policy mattered. That a budget was a blueprint. Now I know better. A blueprint for whom? For what? For another layer of PowerPoint slides shown to smirking dickwads in AC conference halls drinking machine-foamed coffee while their staff is paid in exposure and curry puffs.

Meanwhile, I’m here trying to calculate if I can stretch 73 rupees to buy eggs and paracetamol, because apparently, having an immune system is a luxury now, not a given.

Ah, the brain fog, yes. I can smell it like stale piss on tiles. You know the smell. Not immediate. Not aggressive. Just gently awful. Like a fart left in a jar, opened slowly in a church.

Science tells us depression isn’t sadness—it’s dysfunction. Like a misfiring neural capacitor. One part of the brain starts hoarding serotonin like a greedy goblin, and suddenly the whole network collapses into a marshland of self-doubt and sweat. You can read all the fMRI studies you want—those heatmaps look like they’re tracking turbulence in the psyche of God himself.

But what use is understanding synaptic signaling when you can’t make yourself shower?

I once tried explaining my symptoms to a government doctor. He looked at me like I’d asked him to diagnose the Moon. Gave me a blister pack of expired vitamins and a pamphlet on “positive thinking.” Which is like giving a drowning man a scented napkin.

And all this—this mental fucking bogroll of my daily life—was happening parallel to budget day. The country looking forward. Me, sideways. The government claiming GDP growth. Me, trying to grow a pair just to survive till lunch.

It ends, not in drama, not in fire, not in some genius insight or enlightenment. It ends like this:

With me sitting on the toilet, constipated from cheap rice and worse thoughts, listening to a YouTuber say, "This is a game-changing budget," while I’m trying to remember if I wiped properly last time or if that vague itch is just another symptom of my declining hygiene standards.

Or possibly a metaphor for this entire bloody country.
