Most of the people I’ve sketched on this blog—and I say this with the full knowledge that some of them might still be alive and capable of accessing WiFi—are, frankly, homely as fuck.  
We’re talking busted. Misshapen. Anatomically confusing. Not just a little asymmetry here and there, not just endearing imperfections like a mole shaped like a doomed continent or a lazy eye that occasionally syncs up during eclipses—no, I mean full-on bodily monstrosities.  

We’re talking areolas the size of tea coasters.  
Knees that look like they’re planning something.  
Elbows with texture.  
Skin with memories.  
Hair where evolution forgot to turn off the faucet.  
One bloke had toes like tiny thumbs and a scrotum that looked like it had seen trench warfare.  

And most of them are naked. Not titillatingly naked. Not boudoir, scented candle, post-coital glow kind of naked.  
Just *naked*.  
As in: raw chicken skin, belly folds, armpit stubble, tan lines, stray lint, semi-flaccid but deeply opinionated penises, droopy breasts with moods of their own.  
Naked like truth, not like porn.  
Naked like birth and death, not like romance.  
Naked like the moment you realize the human body is not a temple, it’s a fucking meat locker with duct tape and panic holding it together.

And still—still—I sketch them. I look. I look longer.  
Because under that mess, behind the stretch marks and bulbous joints and suspicious moles, there's a thing humming.  
A pattern. A pulse.  
A goddamn neural manifold vibrating with the shittiest, ugliest, most wonderful form of sentience we’ve ever accidentally booted up on this piss-streaked rock.

It’s easy to fall for the beautiful ones.  
Symmetry’s cheap. Evolution outsourced attraction to angles and gloss.  
Tits and chins and hip-to-waist ratios are statistical lies we agreed to call truth.  
But symmetry is not personality.  
Prettiness is not honesty.  
And fuckability is not fucking *value*.  

I’ve seen the neural net fire beneath a half-toothless tea seller’s twitching eyelid.  
I’ve seen cognitive elegance trapped in bodies that looked like they were drawn by a drunk god in a hurry.  
I’ve seen shameful, beautiful thoughts writ large in the shrug of a dislocated shoulder, in a finger permanently bent by labor and not corrected because hospitals are for rich people and cowards.

We are so goddamn trained—**so cock-whipped by symmetry and skin tone**—that we forget the whole machine is running upstairs.  
In that sludgy meat sponge.  
In the cortex loops and thalamus clatter.  
In predictive coding so fragile that a single sugar crash can make you sob during toothpaste ads.  
But do we see it?  
Do we fuck.  

We see jawlines.  
We see eye color.  
We see caste-coded fairness filters and five o'clock shadows removed by ten-thousand-rupee creams that smell like colonized citrus.  
We see what was branded desirable by three centuries of racism, five decades of cinema, and two years of algorithmic grooming by platforms that couldn’t care less if you were loved, as long as you clicked long enough to buy a goddamn razor.

Sometimes I sketch and wonder—how much genius has been lost to halitosis?  
How many fucking friends never became friends because the first ten milliseconds of face-matching didn’t pass the limbic audit?  
How many life-saving, mind-fucking, soul-unzipping relationships aborted at the epidermis checkpoint?  

We won’t know.  
Because we chose aesthetics over insight.  
We chose filters over fractals.  
We chose dopamine hits over durational thinking.  
We chose to swipe left on the most interesting people alive because their noses had opinions or their tits pointed at slightly divergent political directions.

This isn’t a call to kumbaya bullshit. I’m not saying every ugly bastard is a misunderstood genius.  
Some of them are just cunts.  
But so are the pretty ones.  
And at least the ugly ones don’t pretend it’s scented.  
There’s no mystique.  
Just meat.  
Which means less performance, more fucking honesty.  
More raw data.  
More high-dimensional sadness.  

I’ll take that any day over a filtered chucklefuck whose personality is three borrowed memes and a yoga mat.  

What’s inside matters.  
What’s *really* inside.  
The synaptic drift.  
The priors.  
The stochastic hallucination that is memory.  
The sweaty, flabby, neurotic miracle of a brain trying to guess its own next thought.  
That’s where the beauty is.  
That’s where the sketch lives.

So if you’re ever sketched here—and you see your nipple rendered like a topographic map, or your belly described in four shades of putty and one of sadness—don’t fucking complain.  
You made the cut.  
You showed up.  
You stayed still.  
You let the manifold leak through your godawful posture and your defiant body hair.  

And you know what?

I saw you.
