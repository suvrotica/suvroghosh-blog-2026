It started with a blister on my left asscheek that wouldn’t pop.  
Just sat there like a shy but aggressive old woman in a government queue, squatting over my underwear seam like it had a fucking property deed, refusing to budge or ooze or do the decent thing and *drain*, like pustules are supposed to in polite society.  
I’d forgotten I even had an ass mirror. But there I was, one leg propped like a depressed flamingo on the toilet lid, checking the contour of my own glute for signs of bacterial civilization.

Now listen—this is the meatspace. The real you.  

All these people walking around with smooth foreheads and AI-curated cheekbones and dentist-scraped Instagram smiles, thinking they’re gods because their shit doesn’t make sound when it lands in the bowl (spoiler: it does, they just flush fast), they don't realize they’re just flesh sleeves for whatever busted-ass neural network is firing half-assed predictions in their skulls.

You wanna know who your soulmate is? It's not that girl who gives you a semi with one smile and then quietly posts motivational quotes about boundaries and toxic energy and reiki. It’s that short, foul-mouthed bastard at your local hardware shop who somehow remembers your name despite forty years of smoking what smells like burnt pubes in a glass chillum and calls you “sir” sarcastically even though he’s older than your father and twice as limber. He’s got halitosis that could bleach tile grout. His eyebrows are tectonic. But inside, there’s a neural manifold singing Bach. Or at least heavy metal with tight rhythm.  

You just can't fucking hear it over your own Pavlovian lust response.

I remember this kid from my school days. Rajat. Looked like someone had tried to sculpt a boy out of poorly set jelly and then given up halfway to go have a wank. Buck teeth, naturally. Head shaped like a turned potato. Talked like he’d just swallowed a spoon of peanut butter but wanted to finish the sentence anyway. We tortured him. You would’ve too. We were all assholes.  

But that motherfucker could write BASIC code like he was born with a FOR loop in his amniotic fluid. Made a cricket simulator that worked better than my father’s actual income. I didn’t get it back then. Thought he was just “good with computers.” Thought that mattered less than his face.  

Later in life, I watched one of the kids who mocked him end up selling fucking diet pills to aunties on WhatsApp while Rajat went to work for some Austrian AI lab optimizing protein folding algorithms. I wanted to reach out and apologize, but you can’t send a sorry text for years of being a chuckle fuck.

Thing is, the world runs on *surface area*. And not the cool kind that affects heat transfer in thermodynamics, no. The other kind. Skin. Smile. Symmetry. All the cheap bullshit nature evolved to trick other apes into mating, the same way anglerfish use a fucking headlamp to lure their victims in the dark ocean where even God doesn’t bother looking.

You think casteism’s bad? Try prettiness-ism. 

It’s why every HR department looks like a B-grade Bengali remake of an American sitcom.  
It’s why even revolutionary leftist men secretly want a fuckable comrade with clear skin and unhairy nipples.  
It’s why I can’t go five minutes without remembering every goddamn party in my twenties where someone’s eyes slid off me like I was a mildly offensive ad.  

I’m not bitter.  
Okay, I’m bitter.  

But not because I didn’t get laid. I got laid, okay? Twice. Both times accidental. One was a nurse with a morphine problem.  
I’m bitter because I know what I am. I’m ugly in the classic way—so classic, in fact, I should be in a textbook. Roman nose, pockmarked forehead, eyebrows that look like they’ve seen shit and don’t want to talk about it.  

But up here? (Taps temple like a sleazy motivational speaker.)  
Fucking fireworks, bro.  
Fucking Hilbert spaces and multidimensional embeddings and a half-functional model of social dynamics that I had to assemble like IKEA furniture using missing screws and second-hand Wittgenstein.  
But no one wants to date a goddamn neural manifold.  
They want a chin that photographs well.

And don’t get me started on the caste bullshit. Caste is just hereditary prettiness with the rules written down.  
Add colorism and you get a full-blown firmware-level genocide protocol disguised as "matrimonial preference."  

You ask someone, “Why don’t you ever date dark-skinned girls?” and they say “I just don’t find them attractive,” like that’s a *fact* and not a centuries-long dopamine-conditioning algorithm hammered into your dick by colonialism, fairness cream ads, and aunties with Stockholm syndrome.

My best friend now?  
Looks like a toad that’s been sat on by regret.  
Burps while he thinks.  
Smells like pickled onion most days.  
But I’d trust him with my funeral playlist.  
And in a world where people ghost you faster than a Delhi Uber driver once he sees you holding a cash note, that means more than six-pack abs or a jawline you could use to slice pork belly.

I used to dream of being loved for my *mind*.  
What a fucking scam that turned out to be.  
Nobody loves your mind unless it’s wrapped in a fuckable TED Talk accent and comes with stock images of neurons lighting up like a Diwali ad for neuroplasticity.  

The real minds, the sharp ones?  
They’re twitchy.  
They say weird things.  
They ask questions during small talk.  
They smell weird.  
They hiccup during blowjobs.  
They cry when no one’s looking because entropy keeps winning.

But they’re beautiful.  
Not in the Hallmark way.  
In the way old circuit boards are beautiful.  
In the way lunar maps are beautiful—pitted, cratered, hostile, but full of history and hidden logic.  

I want to live in a world where ugly people get the mic.  
Where farts during sex don’t kill the mood but become a harmony.  
Where teeth aren’t bleached but celebrated like geological anomalies.  
Where your soulmate shows up drunk at your door, shoeless, ranting about JavaScript closures, and you let them in anyway because you know—*you fucking know*—that inside that crusty fuck is the one person who’s seen your algorithmic soul and not run screaming.

But I don’t live in that world.

I live in one where I once brushed my teeth, looked in the mirror, and saw that my left eye was drooping not from a stroke, but from three decades of being told I didn’t deserve desire unless I looked like someone else.  
I live in one where I still sometimes apologize when I sneeze in public, because I’m ugly and loud and shouldn’t occupy space audibly.  
I live in one where the best conversation I had last year was with a dog that mistook my testicles for something edible.  

And I said thank you.  
Because that dog *looked me in the eyes* when it licked me.
