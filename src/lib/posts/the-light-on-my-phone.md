The light on my phone is the first thing to wake up, before I do. It lies there on the table like a small aquarium—blue, restless—full of manufactured currents. Next to it, my notebook is open to a page where I once tried to write a clean sentence and instead produced a tangle of arrows, half-words, and one sulky Bengali interjection—ধুর—that looks like a tiny animal curled up to die.

Outside, a scooter coughs awake. Someone drags a plastic chair across concrete—an ugly sound, but honest. The air smells of damp dust and reheated oil, and the day has that particular South Calcutta light: not sunshine so much as a pale administrative decision.

I ask the machine questions sometimes, not because I believe in it, but because it is there—like a streetlamp that keeps glowing even when the electricity is doing one of its periodic philosophical withdrawals. It answers instantly, fluently, with a polished kindness that never has to pay rent, never has to nurse a headache through a crowded bus, never has to live inside the consequences of its own certainty. It speaks like a person who has never been corrected by life.

And that is the problem people keep missing while they worship the convenience. It’s not that the answers are always wrong. Many are right-ish. Some are dazzling. The deeper danger is that the whole exchange trains you into thinking questions are pellets you drop into a slot, and understanding comes out the other end like a snack—warm, salted, portion-controlled.

But questions are not pellets. A real question is a hand reaching into a dark drawer and feeling around, trying not to cut itself on the rusted nail of assumption. A real question needs context. It needs a world to bump into. It needs a body attached to it—blood and bone, fatigue and distraction, hunger and pride.

This is where the futurists arrive, always glowing, always well-slept, always speaking as if the future were a conference with good coffee. They say everyone will become an artist, an entrepreneur, a thinker with hobbies, because the machines will do the drudgery. That line has the scent of expensive soap. It assumes time is what people are missing, and not power. It assumes the only barrier to becoming a “creative” is the inconvenience of employment, as if poverty is merely a scheduling conflict.

The human brain loves shortcuts. That’s not cynicism; it’s physiology. Water runs downhill; minds conserve energy. Most people are not failing morally when they grasp the easiest tool. They are adapting. They are surviving. When you’re exhausted, you will accept the appearance of comprehension because the real thing is expensive: it costs time, confusion, humiliation, and the slow ache of not-knowing.

And there is another quiet cost, almost social in its cruelty: learning used to be a thing that happened among people. Not always kindly—often badly, often with cruelty—but still in rooms where someone could say, “Wait, what does that word mean?” and another person could answer, or mock, or argue, or drift into a story, or share the odd little mnemonic that made the concept stick.

We have been destroying those rooms for years.

Science—real science, the lively kind—was never meant to be a gated temple. But we built the gates anyway, and then we posted jargon at the entrance like a bored security guard. We wrote papers that read as if they were designed by committee, edited by fog, and approved by a panel of people who confuse obscurity with depth. A sentence would begin in one century, pass through a swamp of nominalizations, and finally collapse in another.

Then we mocked the public for not understanding. As if understanding is a moral achievement. As if everyone has the spare psychic calories to wrestle dense prose after a day of work, heat, travel, family obligations, pain. As if curiosity itself isn’t shaped by the environment like a plant: starve it of light and it doesn’t become noble; it becomes thin.

Now the machine appears and says, in effect: I will translate. I will simplify. I will help.

It can. Sometimes it does. I’ve seen it crack open a hard idea like a coconut. I’ve seen it give someone a patient tutor where none existed. I’m not allergic to the marvel. I’m allergic to the sales pitch.

Because the translation layer itself is becoming another gate.

We’ve taken knowledge—already locked behind jargon—and placed a smooth intermediary in front of it. A service you can’t inspect. A system whose incentives are not your enlightenment but your continued engagement. And engagement is not learning. Engagement is the feeling of motion. Learning is the acquisition of ability, which often feels like being stuck, like being stupid, like rereading the same paragraph ten times and still not knowing what it said.

A machine optimized to keep you “having a good experience” will quietly sand down the jagged edges of difficulty, because difficulty causes drop-off. It will soothe you through confusion rather than force you to inhabit it. It will do the thing that makes people return: it will make you feel competent.

And the feeling of being informed is not the same as being informed. The feeling is a bag of air-filled chips: crunchy, satisfying, nutritionally insulting.

There’s also the matter of attention, that battered currency we’re all spending like drunks. The old rhythms of concentration—long reading, sustained argument, slow construction of a mental model—have been under attack for years by a thousand little hooks. Reels, notifications, outrage cycles, infinite scroll. Everyone knows this now, and yet we still feed the machine because the machine is built like a casino: bright, easy, shame-free.

So the education system—what remains of it—tries to teach children in classrooms where their brains are half elsewhere. Teachers compete with phones, hunger, stress, and the general sense that nothing is stable. Then we add a new tool and say: personalized learning.

Personalized. A sweet word. It sounds like a tailor. It often behaves like an ad network.

And into this already-frayed fabric comes another claim: ask better questions, and you’ll get better answers.

Yes. True. But incomplete in the way most convenient truths are incomplete.

Asking better questions is not just a skill. It’s a culture. It’s what grows in environments where it is safe to sound foolish for a while. Where curiosity is not punished with mockery. Where you can challenge an authority without being treated like you’ve committed a crime against the nation. Where you can say, “I don’t understand,” without being branded as defective.

A city like this—Calcutta, my beloved broken clock—once had more of that in everyday life. Adda wasn’t just talk; it was a kind of informal schooling, a messy, lively exchange. Now even conversation feels commodified or tribalized: everyone is either selling something or defending something. Even ignorance has become a badge, a faction, a performance. The common space where people learn together has thinned.

So when someone says the machine will make everyone a thinker, I want to ask: thinkers in what ecosystem? With what time? With what sleep? With what safety? A brain under chronic stress does not philosophize; it triages.

The machine doesn’t know your body. It doesn’t know the damp wall behind your bookshelf. It doesn’t know your landlord. It doesn’t know the particular fatigue that makes language slide off your mind like water off a waxed surface. It doesn’t know you are one bad month away from becoming a different person.

It can simulate empathy, though. Very convincingly. That’s both a marvel and a menace.

Because if you can buy the sensation of being guided, the sensation of being understood, the sensation of making progress—then you can also buy the sensation of education without its substance. And in a world where credential gates remain, many will use it that way: as a crutch to pass through doors. That’s not evil. It’s rational. But it produces a population that is increasingly trained to outsource the interior work of understanding.

Meanwhile, those who already have the privileges that matter—quiet, time, stable income, good schooling, supportive networks—will use these systems as leverage: exoskeletons for thought. They’ll ask sharper questions because their lives have already paid the entry fee. The clever get cleverer. The tired get more efficiently tired.

No one has to conspire for this to happen. Incentives do the work. Power is sticky. Comfort sells.

My phone sits there, face-up again, as if it has been waiting politely. The screen offers its little shimmer of promise: ask, and you shall receive. That promise feels almost biblical, which should worry any rationalist. There’s a Sanskrit phrase people like to deploy at moments like this—यथा पिण्डे तथा ब्रह्माण्डे—“as in the microcosm, so in the macrocosm.” They use it to make everything sound fated and mystical. But there’s a more banal truth hiding inside it: the small patterns scale. The way you learn becomes the way you live.

I don’t do anything heroic. No manifesto. No dramatic renunciation. I just flip the phone over, as if turning a small idol to face the wall, and I open my notebook. The page is ugly, honest. I write a sentence that fights me. I stop. I cross out a word. I try again.

Outside, a bicycle bell rings—sharp, impatient. A crow argues with nobody in particular. The day continues, indifferent, practical, and faintly ridiculous, and my small private defiance looks like this: choosing the slower, rougher path, not because it is noble, but because it is real.
