The crack in my Android screen has its own weather system now—tiny white fault-lines that catch the tea-stall light and refract it into a nervous, glittering map, like the Ganges delta if the Ganges were made of tempered glass and human negligence. There’s thumb oil smeared across the lower half where my scrolling finger lives, and under that smear a man is speaking—calmly, confidently, with the tonal assurance of someone who has never had to argue with an electricity bill—announcing a policy, a threat, a promise, a rupture, a new dawn, a nation-in-peril, the usual buffet. Behind him the background is the sort of patriotic blur that can be manufactured in any country with three flags and a bored graphic designer.

The tea stall TV is barking at a different truth, louder, uglier, more analog. A kettle hisses. Someone’s scooter refuses to start and the kick lever is taking a beating. My downstairs neighbor's pet cat "Taklu Babu", considers the philosophical question of whether my slipper's plastic is a recommended nail sharpener. The man on my phone continues speaking, and for a brief moment my brain does the old lazy thing it learned from living in India: it tries to decide truth by vibe. He *sounds* like him. His pauses are familiar. The cadence is right. The consonants land where they should. The vowels have that particular rounded confidence that comes from never taking a tram.

Then my cousin forwards the same clip into the family WhatsApp group with the caption: “see! finally someone is saying it.” And WhatsApp adds that small grey tag—“forwarded many times”—like a priest sprinkling a drop of disinfectant into a municipal water tank.

This is where we are now: authenticity as a rumor with UI.

They tell us we will have labels. They say the label should cover ten percent—ten percent of the visual, ten percent of the audio, ten percent of the lie. Ten percent is a wonderful bureaucratic number. It’s large enough to feel moral and small enough to be ignored, like the “service charge” on a restaurant bill. Ten percent is also, coincidentally, about how much of my daily attention I can spare for anything that isn’t survival, deadlines, or the low-grade existential nausea of living among people who treat superstition like a pension plan.

But the problem is not the label. The problem is the human animal, that melodramatic primate who will happily accept a forged voice note if it confirms what he already suspects about his neighbor, his party, his nation, his wife, his own importance. Give him a stamp—“AI GENERATED”—and he will treat it as either a badge of modernity (*look, even the machine agrees with me*) or as proof of conspiracy (*they labeled it to silence the truth*). Labels, in India, do not create trust. They create new genres of argument.

This is the Age of Beautiful Nonsense, and beauty is the worst part, because ugly propaganda at least has the decency to look like propaganda. Ugly lies give off a smell. Beautiful lies arrive perfumed, in HD, with perfect lighting and a face that holds still like an obedient idol.

I keep thinking about the word “document,” which everyone now chants with the reverence once reserved for “scripture.” Document, from the Latin *docere*, to teach. A document is supposed to teach you something—show you a trail, a source, an origin, a lineage. In practice, in modern life, a document teaches you mostly about power: who can demand it, who can produce it, and who gets humiliated in the queue when the ink is slightly smudged and the clerk feels bored.

Now they want machines to be documented too. Models, training data, safety processes, transparency rituals. Paperwork for the gods we built. There is something almost touching about it—humans facing a new ocean and bringing out their little measuring cups.

The Europeans, in their way, are trying to treat synthetic gibberish as a “security surface,” which is an excellent phrase because it sounds like a corporate mattress. A security surface: the place where bad things can land. They look at a viral clip and see attack vectors, systemic risk, platform obligations, audits, codes, compliance. They speak in the language of levers and duties.

India, in its way, wants quantifiable labeling because India understands quantification. We are a civilization of forms. We do not trust a person’s face, but we trust a stamp. We trust a stamp so much we will accept a stamp even when it is obviously fake, because the stamp is the ritual and rituals calm us. *দেখুন, কাগজ আছে তো*—look, there is paper, no?

But the planet we live on is not a court file. It is a forwarding machine.

The dumbest step destroys truth first. Not the clever adversary. Not the state actor with a budget. Not the shadowy lab. The dumbest step: someone screen-records, someone screenshots, someone compresses, someone reposts, someone forwards it with their own caption, someone crops out the watermark because it “spoils the view,” someone sends it as a WhatsApp video because it’s “easier,” and the provenance trail—those signed manifests, those credentials, those carefully embedded metadata prayers—evaporates like a puddle on a May footpath.

Truth dies not in fire, but in re-encoding.

People in clean offices are building provenance systems—Content Credentials, signatures, manifests—like little birth certificates for images. I can see the appeal. It’s the same old human longing: to pin identity down so it stops slipping through your fingers. When my father dealt with a bank account, he trusted the ledger. When I deal with the internet, I’m being asked to trust a torrent.

But provenance works best where ordinary people least live: inside the sleek, polite corridors of platforms that preserve metadata, respect standards, and don’t treat your content like a chicken to be plucked and sold in parts. Meanwhile, the real India—the India of family groups and voice notes and forwarded folklore—lives in the screenshot. We live in the copy-of-a-copy-of-a-copy, the third-generation JPEG where the pixels have become little anxious ghosts.

So you get this absurdity: “Prove where it came from” becomes a product feature, a neat toggle, a ribbon on a gift box—while the everyday flow of information, the *actual bloodstream*, is a series of amputations.

If I sound bitter, it’s because bitterness is one of the few renewable resources we have. It requires no import license and survives power cuts beautifully.

In Sector V—our glassy little office park where dreams go to become spreadsheets—you can already imagine a new job category: “labeling reality.” A fluorescent cubicle, an employee badge, a quota. You sit all day with two windows open—one showing a piece of content, the other showing a drop-down menu of compliance categories—and you decide whether something is synthetic, manipulated, misleading, satirical, harmful, political, violent, medical, financial, impersonation, “other.” It’s like grading essays, except the essays are lies and your red pen is a legal risk mitigation tool.

The strangest part is that this labor will be sold as progress. A new industry! New jobs! Trust & safety! Meanwhile it’s still a kind of piecework: invisible, exhausting, and morally degrading. You are not building anything; you are shoveling. The flood rises, you shovel.

They will tell you, with straight faces, that users can report content. Users can block. Users can fact-check. Users can educate themselves. Users can be “responsible digital citizens.” This is the modern platform bargain: we will extract attention rents and sell ads against your eyeballs, and you will do unpaid moderation to keep the system vaguely habitable. It’s like being charged rent for a building and then asked to sweep the staircase because “community.”

Every era has its sacred object. In my childhood it was the textbook, heavy and authoritative, smelling of cheap paper and punishment. Now the sacred object is the clip: a 17-second rectangle that arrives already carrying its own mood, its own implied conclusion, its own pre-chewed outrage. The clip doesn’t argue; it performs. It doesn’t persuade; it infects.

And because we are performing monkeys with smartphones, the clip wins.

The geostrategic people will say: this is an authenticity arms race. Deepfake operations versus provenance tooling. State actors versus standards bodies. Elections versus disinformation. All very grand, all very chessboard.

But the supply chain that matters is not only chips. It’s transformers, permits, water, and diesel.

Somewhere behind a shiny “AI-ready” building—those glass fortresses that look like they were designed by a committee of smug rectangles—there’s a generator coughing like an old smoker who refuses to die. The building will have a sustainability banner. There will be a press release. There will be a “net-zero roadmap,” which is the modern equivalent of “my ancestors were kings.” Behind it, the generator will burn fuel because the grid is fragile, because transformers have lead times, because interconnection queues are long, because the unsexy hardware of civilization is always the bottleneck.

So the Age of Beautiful Nonsense is not only a cognitive crisis. It’s physical. It has a footprint. Every extra stream of AI slop is a little tug on the electrical system. Every “talking head” video is heat somewhere. Noise you can measure in megawatts. The internet used to feel weightless; now it’s starting to feel like a factory you can smell.

Kolkata, of course, will pay in the usual way: in humidity and inconvenience and resentment. A load-shedding here, a voltage dip there, an inverter battery groaning in the corner like a sick animal. The rich will sit inside cooled rooms and complain about “connectivity issues” while the rest of us listen to the ceiling fan slow down and speed up like a drunk philosopher.

And then, because a society cannot tolerate uncertainty without reaching for a stick, we will solve the “deepfake problem” the way we solve many problems: with surveillance.

This is the part that makes my skin crawl, not in a dramatic way, but in that small domestic way—like realizing your pillow smells faintly of mold. Anti-disinformation easily becomes pro-surveillance, because “verify identity” is such a tempting phrase. Face ID, CCTV analytics, SIM/KYC, biometric “liveness tests,” mandatory declarations. The state will say it’s to protect you from fraud and fake content. It will be true, in the way a lion is truly interested in your safety when it corrals you.

Enforcement capacity is always the rate-limiter, not the text of the rule. You can write a beautiful law. You can publish a code of practice. You can announce obligations with the seriousness of a judge. Then you need courts, regulators, labs, expertise, budgets, and a political culture that isn’t allergic to accountability. Without that, the rule becomes theater. Compliance becomes a performance. Everyone learns the moves. The underlying incentives—the attention rents, the ad-tech machinery, the platform gatekeeping—keep humming.

The result is a world where disbelief is formalized.

I keep thinking about dignity. Not in a lofty way. In a small, humiliating way. Your auntie hears a voice note that sounds like her nephew asking for money, and she’s torn between love and skepticism. Love used to be a shortcut—*I recognize you, therefore I trust you*. Now love becomes a vulnerability surface. She has to doubt her own ears. She has to become a forensic analyst in a cotton saree. She has to remember “reasonable technical measures.” She has to ask for a code word like spies. This is what it means when sincerity becomes a luxury good: only the people with time, education, and spare attention can afford to verify. Everyone else lives in probabilistic fog.

The fog isn’t evenly distributed, either. Deepfakes get extra cover in Bengali and other Indian languages because we live in a world of accents, code-switching, clipped consonants, and affectionate distortions. “Sounds like him” does half the work. The other half is the social structure: a culture that already runs on hearsay and hierarchy and fear of embarrassment. No one wants to be the person who asks too many questions in the family group. You’ll be labeled “negative.” In India, skepticism is often treated as a personality defect.

So the flood comes, and we meet it with what we always meet things with: superstition, bureaucracy, and resignation, in some unstable mixture.

There’s a debunk that arrives later, of course. Debunks always arrive later, like ambulance sirens in a traffic jam. The debunk is itself a clip—slicker, sharper, with a confident narrator explaining that the original was fake. Under it someone comments: “this is also fake.” Under that someone posts a third clip, “proof” that the debunk is part of a cover-up. The system has learned a new trick: it can generate not only lies, but counter-lies, and meta-lies, and lies about lies, until your brain gives up and chooses a team.

This is the truly modern horror: not that we can’t know what’s true, but that we get tired of trying.

At College Street, a student buys a secondhand textbook—pages damp at the edges, margins filled with someone else’s underlining, someone else’s anxieties—and writes an essay with a model. The professor knows. The student knows the professor knows. The professor uses AI to grade it because the workload is insane and salaries are insulting and the institution is rotting in slow motion. Both feel oddly relieved. Authenticity becomes a negotiated truce. Education turns into an arms race, then into fatigue, then into theater.

In my darker moments—my more honest ones—I suspect that’s the destination for public life too: a kind of exhausted pantomime where everyone performs belief just enough to get through the day.

Still, my brain insists on taking the long way round, as if a digression could save me.

There’s a debunked folk etymology I always liked, even though it’s wrong, because it fits our current mood: people say “news” stands for “north east west south,” as if information is a compass. It isn’t. Real etymology is less romantic: “news” is just “new things.” That’s all. New things, happening. The compass story is nonsense, and it comforts because it suggests there’s direction.

We are living through the collapse of the compass story. “New things” arrive faster than meaning can be made. The feed is not a compass; it’s a slot machine. It dispenses outrage, cuteness, terror, patriotism, and scams in an optimized sequence. Attention engineering—autoplay, infinite scroll, notification lotteries—turns the mind into a twitching lab rat. Then we act surprised when the rat can’t write philosophy.

I look at my cracked screen again. The man’s face is still calm. The calmness is almost insulting. Synthetic faces look calmer than real citizens because they are not made of flesh and consequence. They don’t sweat. They don’t stammer. They don’t have that tiny panic in the eyes that comes from knowing you might be wrong.

A tram rattles past in my memory—North Calcutta, the old metallic groan, that improbable gentleness of public transport that asks nothing of you except patience. Now the modern tram is the reel-audio leaking from earbuds in the metro, a disembodied chorus of other people’s moods. Progress, as always, manufactures convenience; convenience manufactures credulity; credulity invites control.

Outside, the tea stall kettle whistles again. A cybercrime helpline poster curls at the corner, laminated optimism. A UPI QR board leans against the wall, its edges warped from damp, as if even the plastic is tired. Someone pays with a beep and feels modern for half a second.

My phone buzzes. Another forward. Another clip. Another voice that sounds like someone I know.

I wipe the thumb oil off my screen with the edge of my shirt, the way you wipe fog off a bathroom mirror, and the crack catches the light and turns it into a tiny constellation—proof, at least, that some kinds of distortion still come from honest physics.
