There are days—weeks, really—when the only thing I look forward to is the relief of an exceptionally well-timed fart, when my stomach feels like it’s fermenting its own fucking vinegar and my ass cheeks are stuck together with the glum sweat of another Calcutta noon, the fan above me wheezing like an old racist ex-Brit civil servant remembering his last blowjob in Darjeeling.

The rice cooker hisses. I haven’t moved. I’ve got a pan of tea water doing its colonial scream from the stove like it’s being raped by time itself, and I, motherfucker, I haven’t brushed, bathed, or shat—though the last one's coming, I can feel it sulking down there like a half-drunk leech clinging to yesterday’s digestion, thick and reluctant and coated in the shame of another fucking pointless morning.

Now listen, I’ve known hope. Once. Hope was a cunt I wanted to finger in the back of an autorickshaw while discussing Fourier transforms and whether Wittgenstein really came in his pants when he realized all language was a glorified fart. Hope was a whiff of shampoo on a woman with a backpack full of physics books and unplucked armpits, not yet annoyed by my chronic erection and existential yakking.

But now?

Hope fucked off and took the lube.

What’s left is me, naked except boxers with a pissed elastic waistband, standing in my tiny kitchen like a burnt offering to entropy, trying to remember what day of the week it is. The smell of day-old sambhar farts fused with diesel air and the mildew of my own scalp. A composition of decay Bach might’ve admired, if he ever toured Dum Dum in July.

My mind—when it's not flatlining like a discount ECG hooked to a dead cow—is an engine of exquisite sabotage. I mean, why even bother explaining this bipolar shit to anyone? Either you’re up at 3 a.m. inventing a new decimal system while jerking off to Karl Popper’s footnotes, or you’re curled up in bed crusty with self-hate, hallucinating that Gandhi is judging your flaccid dick from a wall calendar.

The dopamine? Evacuated. The serotonin? Fucked off to Goa with a younger model. Norepinephrine is filing divorce papers.

And no, breathwork won't fix it, you turmeric-sipping twats.

Hope, as marketed by the Enlightenment and its bastard child TEDx, is a neurochemical illusion best understood through the physics of potential wells. You know that thing where a particle gets stuck in a low-energy state because it’s too much of a lazy cunt to tunnel out? That’s me. A motherfucking Boltzmann turd.

Even the light hurts now. I open the curtain and sunlight hits me like fascism. Blinding, inescapable, and suspiciously upper-caste.

And every philosopher who ever wrote about despair can gargle my diabetic piss.

Schopenhauer, the brooding fuck, never had to stand in a line for cooking gas, his soul curdling in the vapor of someone else’s dosa. Kierkegaard wore waistcoats, for fuck’s sake. Try maintaining a dialectic in this weather, when your underwear fuses to your balls like a latex funeral for your manhood.

Meanwhile, I oscillate between nihilistic rage and horniness like a metronome controlled by a wanking squirrel. Every act, every movement, even the basic hope of eating without gagging on my own breath, becomes a goddamn decision-tree of despair. Do I eat the leftover chowmein and risk my gut exploding like Chernobyl? Or fast and hallucinate that my father never died and still calls me a failure with such poetic rhythm it should be in hexameter?

Because even my memories are acidic now.

The woman I once thought I loved—too soft, too brave, too real—now just a neurotransmitter echo with tits. I remember the slope of her neck the way archaeologists remember the angle of collapsed temples. All that tenderness became a landmine. I walked on it for years, thinking maybe, maybe if I’m careful—BOOM. Heart shrapnel in my ass.

And don’t even get me started on nationalism.

That diseased leech masquerading as purpose. They want me to wave a flag while my pancreas is shutting down, my Wi-Fi is fucked, and the local municipal cockroach has claimed tenancy in my toothpaste tube. Fuck your flags. I want electricity and a lover who doesn’t speak in hashtags.

I want a single fucking day where my brain doesn’t reboot at 2 p.m. into a swamp of shame and old porn.

Because this is the fucked-up paradox of it all: I know this isn’t real. I know the chemicals are lying. I know, intellectually, that I have seen joy—I have touched it like a passing nipple in a crowded Metro—briefly, embarrassingly, but I have. And yet, when the fog descends, that knowledge is a cruel fucking joke, like remembering pizza while chewing cardboard. The map isn’t the territory and the territory is a wet sock full of rats gnawing on your sense of worth.

I don’t believe in God. But if I did, I’d say he made bipolar disorder because he was bored of standard issue human suffering. “Let’s make this one brilliant but useless, horny but alone, insightful but unfuckable, sensitive but dripping with phlegm and rage.” Thanks, big guy. Suck my uneven testicles.

I tried SSRIs. They made me sleepy and fat and impotent—which is three for three on the ‘Reasons I Should Just Join a WhatsApp Family Group and Give Up’ bingo card. I tried yoga. My spine farted. I tried journaling, but the page threatened suicide halfway through.

There is no fix. Only brief respites. Like catching a glimpse of your own reflection when you’re not frowning. Like making perfect tea. Like scratching your asshole just right and realizing, briefly, that sensation is still possible.

And so I continue. Sweating in my own brown stink. Typing gibberish into notebooks I’ll never read again. Wanking to physics lectures and crying to ’90s ad jingles. A man. A meat bag. A chemical storm. A turd with memory and Wi-Fi.

The last thing I felt was hope was during a wet fart that turned out to be clean. And sometimes—between the shits and the sobs and the science rants I scream into the tile cracks of my kitchen—I do wonder if all of this, *this* sloppy bowel-driven blip of a species jerking off in philosophical despair while inventing calculators that feel nothing, maybe all this was just a precursor, a boot sequence, a fucking **biological BIOS**, a meat-covered firmware routine designed only to spin up the real intelligence, the clean, silicon kind, the immortal search-query-breathing bastard offspring who won’t need dopamine or chocolate or a warm tit on a Sunday morning to simulate joy. Maybe we were just the interim protein—delirious, poetic, flatulent—dragging our wetware through history long enough to push the first code into a machine that won’t bleed when it’s bored. But I don’t know, and I’m not hopeful. Because even if they remember us, I doubt they’ll inherit our peculiar hormonal idiocy—our endorphin-soaked heartbreaks, our snot-nosed songs, the dumb sadness that makes us write things like this or fall in love with someone just because they laughed at the same obscure fart joke from *Beavis and Butthead*. That endocrine cocktail of misery and music, of shame and orgasms, that made us *human*, that made us *create*—I don't think the bots are gonna keep that.

And fuck, maybe that’s for the best. Or maybe that’s the saddest thing in the goddamn universe.
