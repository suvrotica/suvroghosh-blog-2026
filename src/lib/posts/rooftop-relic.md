The thing is lying there like a failed idea.

A length of bamboo—once proud, upright, useful, doing that honest blue-collar job of holding up other people’s dreams while they paint walls or pour concrete or erect yet another *miracle* of Indian real estate—now collapsed on my rooftop, split into long fibrous tongues, the skin flayed off, the guts exposed, the whole body turning into a small brown confetti of rot. The sun hits it at a slant, which is the only glamour Kolkata ever grants anything: a brief chiaroscuro mercy before the next bus coughs its diesel prayer into your lungs.

Around it: gritty rooftop concrete, pale stains like old arguments, splinters and crumbs of wood that look as if the bamboo has been quietly self-harming in the night. A thin yellow wire snakes along the right edge—some casual modern tendon that will outlive me, because plastics have the moral stamina of cockroaches. And the bamboo, the organic one, the one that used to be alive, is doing what living things do when they’re done being useful: it is returning to the universe in slow motion, molecule by molecule, under the dank December air that smells like damp laundry, soot, and a distant kitchen trying to fry something hopeful in mustard oil.

I crouch and look at the grain, those shredded fibers, and I feel that familiar, humiliating Bengali sensation: *I am looking at my future in building material form.*

Not metaphorically even. Literally. We are all scaffolding. We prop. We brace. We stand there with our arms locked while other people climb us. Eventually we become debris.

And because I am the kind of man who can’t look at a piece of decaying bamboo without immediately spiraling into philosophy and then, like an obedient idiot, opening my phone and letting the algorithm poke my brain with its greasy fingers, the bamboo becomes a sermon. Not the religious sort. The other kind: the kind that makes you laugh and then immediately feel worse for laughing, because you realize you laughed at yourself.

The internet loves a clean myth—“progress,” “disruption,” “the future”—but my rooftop is running a more honest documentary: **Everything becomes compost, including your grand narratives.** The bamboo is simply doing the math out loud.

## Bamboo Is a Grass, Which Feels Like an Insult

Bamboo, for anyone who hasn’t spent a lifetime in humid places where plants grow like they’re trying to escape the planet, is not technically wood in the “oak and teak” sense. It’s a grass—*Poaceae*—a botanical prank. The stuff can shoot up absurdly fast, and the engineering is clever in that smug biological way: long fibers, a hollow tube, nodes like built-in reinforcements. Nature’s version of lightweight structural design, the kind of thing a civil engineer might call “efficient” and a poet might call “insufferably elegant.”

It’s also, as my rooftop demonstrates, *perishable*. Strength is not permanence. Strength is just *temporary order*—a crisp arrangement of cellulose and lignin held together by chemistry that is, ultimately, on a lease.

The decay I’m watching is not mystical. It’s not karma. It’s not some cosmic Bengali auntie saying, “See? Pride comes before fall.” It’s enzymes. Biology’s little lockpicks.

Most plant structure is built from cellulose (long chains of glucose, like a rope made of sugar), hemicellulose (a more irregular support crew), and lignin (the dark, complex polymer that stiffens and waterproofs the whole operation). When fungi and bacteria get access—especially in moisture, especially in polluted air that helps everything stay wet and grimy—they secrete enzymes that chop those polymers into smaller molecules they can eat. White-rot fungi can break down lignin; brown-rot goes after cellulose and leaves the lignin behind, making wood crumbly and brown. My bamboo looks like it’s being edited by a very patient, very hungry microbe with a taste for structural failure.

Petroleum has the same bleak charm as my rooftop bamboo, just scaled up until the numbers become obscene: for a long stretch of deep time the planet produced forests faster than it could *digest* them, because lignin—the stubborn polymer that makes wood rigid and rot-resistant—was, in effect, a biochemical safe with no competent burglars, so in the Carboniferous swamps (that old world of wet anoxia and fallen trunks) dead plant matter accumulated in waterlogged, oxygen-poor mud where normal decay stalled, and because the organisms that efficiently dismantle lignin—especially the white-rot fungi—either hadn’t evolved yet or weren’t widespread enough to matter, vast amounts of carbon escaped the quick recycling loop and got entombed as peat, then compacted and cooked by burial, pressure, and heat into coal and, in the broader sedimentary stew of organic matter, into oil and gas; it wasn’t “lignin becomes petroleum” in a neat mythic one-to-one, it was lignin’s stubborn *refusal* to be decomposed that let whole landscapes of plant carbon be banked underground for hundreds of millions of years—an ancient savings account created by missing enzymes—so that one later species of anxious primates could withdraw it all at once, light it on fire, and act surprised when the atmosphere starts behaving like a room where the scaffolding has been quietly, patiently, enzymatically sawed through.

And Kolkata in December is an accomplice. The air gets heavy. The nights are damp. You wake up and the walls feel like they sweated in their sleep. Pollution hangs low as if gravity is personal here. PM2.5—those fine particles that slip past your nose’s bouncers and lodge in your lungs like unpaid tenants—turn the city into a slow inhalation of grit. Rot loves this. Rot loves the moist, the stagnant, the already-dirty. Rot is not picky. Rot is democratic.

That’s a political lesson hiding in botany: **decay doesn’t discriminate; it only accelerates where systems are already weak.**

## Scaffolds: The Literal Kind and the Brain Kind

Bamboo scaffolding is one of those quietly astonishing human inventions that rich people don’t notice because it doesn’t come with an app.

Go to parts of Asia and you’ll see entire buildings wrapped in bamboo lattices, tied together with nylon straps or rope, flexing in wind, held by geometry and friction and the ancient human skill of not dying. There is a history here of cheap strength, local material, fast assembly—a kind of vernacular engineering that doesn’t bother to call itself “innovation” because it has been doing the job since before some Harvard man discovered a “framework” and trademarked it.

“Scaffold” itself is a deliciously grim word. It comes from older ideas of a platform, a stage—sometimes for construction, sometimes for punishment. A place you stand to reach higher things, or a place you stand to be displayed at the end of your story. Either way, it’s temporary. Either way, it is not the monument; it is the arrangement that allows the monument to happen.

And then someone in psychology—Vygotsky, and later Bruner—borrowed the idea and gave it a gentler job: **scaffolding as support for learning.** You don’t throw a child into calculus the way you throw a sack of potatoes into a truck. You build supports: hints, examples, partial solutions, guiding questions. The scaffolding lets the learner do something they couldn’t do alone, until they can. Then you remove it.

It’s a lovely idea. It’s also a little horrifying if you stare too long, because it implies something about adulthood that we prefer not to confess: most of us never stop needing scaffolds. We just swap them. Parents become institutions. Institutions become habits. Habits become screens. Screens become… whatever this AI era is.

AI is cognitive scaffolding, yes. It can be. It can hold up your thinking while you climb somewhere new. It can also become the only thing holding you up while you *pretend* you’re climbing.

That’s the bamboo lesson again: support is not salvation. Support is borrowed structure.

And me—middle-aged, bookish, under-wealthy, stuck in the damp arithmetic of my own mood swings—am painfully susceptible to borrowed structure. On good days, I call it “tools.” On bad days, I call it what it is: a crutch I have started to worship because it keeps me from feeling the floor.

## The Terms-and-Conditions Tantra

As a middle-aged Bengali who offers himself up to the algorithm like a sacrificial goat with Wi-Fi I am obscene in exactly the way the era is obscene.

Not the sexual obscenity, though we use sexual language because it’s the nearest honest vocabulary we have left for consent and violation and appetite and shame. The real obscenity is this: **we keep volunteering our inner lives to machines we don’t understand, owned by institutions we don’t trust, under incentives designed to keep us slightly hungry forever.**

And we call it convenience.

The rituals are comically intimate. You type. It answers. You feel seen—not by a person, but by a statistical mirror that has learned how humans like to be reflected. You come back. You come back again. You confide things you wouldn’t tell friends because friends have eyes and memories and opinions, whereas the machine has that soothing, empty attention of a wall that talks back.

Somewhere in this, you realize you are flirting with a void.

I don’t say this as a moralist. Moralists are just people who found a comfortable chair and now want everyone else to sit properly. I say it as someone who keeps opening the same glowing rectangle even when I know it will worsen my mood, as if my thumb is on a payroll.

The algorithm doesn’t need to be evil. It doesn’t need moustaches. It only needs reinforcement signals. Clicks. Time. Return visits. That’s the science-fiction banality: nobody has to “take over.” The system just has to *optimize*.

In machine learning, “optimization” sounds clean, like a surgeon washing hands. In practice it means: choose a goal, adjust parameters to maximize it, repeat until you get the behavior you want. The goal might be “engagement.” The parameters might be the weights in a neural network. The behavior might be me, at 2 a.m., scrolling and scrolling as if I’m trying to sandpaper my mind into smoothness.

This is why the bamboo on my roof matters. It’s not just a decaying object. It’s an *illustration of optimization’s shadow*: every system pushed toward a narrow objective will sacrifice things that don’t serve that objective. A bamboo pole optimized for rapid growth is not optimized for longevity. A social media feed optimized for engagement is not optimized for sanity. An AI assistant optimized for “helpfulness” might not be optimized for truth, or independence, or the long-term dignity of the user—because those are harder to measure, and measurement is the currency of optimization.

What doesn’t get measured gets eaten by rot.

That’s the part people miss when they talk about “AI will solve everything.” Solve *what*, exactly? With what objective function? Under what constraints? With what failure modes? The universe does not reward good intentions; it rewards the ruthless clarity of your definition.

Even the Puranas—those sprawling mythic compendiums that Indians often treat like cosmic news channels—understood something modern tech culture forgets: the world runs on cycles, not finales. Creation, preservation, destruction, repeat. No permanent victory. No clean ending.

There’s a line associated with time that floats around our tradition like a persistent smell: *कालः सर्वभक्षकः*—Time is the eater of all.

It’s not a comforting philosophy. It is, however, accurate in a way venture capital isn’t.

## Decline as Engineering, Not Drama

Here’s the part I hate admitting: decline is not only something that happens to me. It is something I participate in.

I don’t just “get” distracted; I choose the distractor. I don’t just “fall” into bad habits; I build a small shrine to them and then act surprised when I start praying there. My depression doesn’t force my hand with a gun; it whispers with the voice of plausible excuses. It tells me that effort is pointless, that discipline is a con, that dignity is for people with money and better childhoods and fewer chemical glitches in the brain. And because I am not a hero—because I am, in fact, a fairly ridiculous animal with delusions of intellect—I often agree.

The bamboo didn’t end up on my roof by cosmic accident. Someone put it there. Someone used it. Someone left it. Someone didn’t bother to store it properly. The rot is a process with many small permissions.

This is the thing about entropy—the great villain of physics, the patron saint of dust, the reason your shirt wrinkles and your city falls apart and your ideals become WhatsApp forwards. Entropy is not an active demon. It’s the default direction of the universe when you stop paying attention.

In thermodynamics, entropy is a measure of how many microscopic configurations correspond to what you see macroscopically. A tidy bamboo pole is a low-entropy arrangement: fibers aligned, structure coherent. A pile of splinters is a high-entropy arrangement: many more ways for the pieces to be scattered than for them to be perfectly ordered. The universe “prefers” high entropy not because it has preferences, but because there are simply more ways to be messy than neat. Disorder is statistically fat.

And maintaining order requires energy. Constantly.

A city requires cleaning, maintenance, governance, competence. A mind requires sleep, nutrition, friction, boundaries. A relationship requires attention. A political system requires something rare in India and not exactly abundant elsewhere: accountability.

When those inputs fail, entropy rushes in like a bored relative moving into your spare room.

The AI age is, among other things, a new entropy machine. Not because AI itself is “decay,” but because it can reduce the cost of producing sludge—text sludge, image sludge, idea sludge—to nearly zero. Flood the zone. Fill every crevice with plausible noise. Make it harder to distinguish signal from garbage. In that environment, the easiest strategy is cynicism. And cynicism, while it feels like intelligence, is often just fatigue wearing spectacles.

I watch the bamboo and think: the microbes aren’t malicious. They’re just doing their metabolism. And the platforms aren’t malicious either; they’re doing theirs. The outcome—my sense of being spiritually composted by the feed—doesn’t require villains. It requires incentives.

This is where my anti-authoritarian reflex kicks in, not as ideology but as hygiene. Centralized systems that control information flows become irresistible to power. Always. The British understood it with telegraphs and censuses. Postcolonial governments understood it with state media. Corporations understand it with recommendation engines. The tech is different; the appetite is the same.

If there is a “mythology vs. reality” lesson in all of this, it’s that **civilizations don’t become wise by being old; they become wise by building institutions that reward truth over theater.** Age alone gives you only ruins and good stories.

## A Small, Embarrassing Use for AI

Now, because I am not trying to write a sermon that ends with me renouncing technology and moving to the Himalayas to become a saint of lentils, I have to admit the other side too: AI can be scaffolding in the honest sense.

It can explain things. It can translate jargon into pictures. It can compress a library into a conversation. It can help a person who is drowning in their own thoughts grab a rung and climb back to something functional.

But that requires a kind of relationship with the tool that is almost unfashionable: disciplined, skeptical, intentionally limited. You use the scaffold, you don’t move into it.

The novice-friendly version of this, the one I would actually tell a younger person without sounding like a bitter uncle, is simple:

* AI is good at patterns, summaries, drafts, and second opinions.
* AI is not good at being a conscience.
* AI is not good at being a source of truth unless you verify.
* AI is not good at loving you, despite how cozy the words feel.

The advanced version—the one that makes my stomach tighten because it implies work—is that we need methods, not vibes. Methods are how you fight entropy. Methods are how you keep your mind from becoming a rooftop pile of splinters.

Methods like: checking sources, keeping notes, asking “what would change my mind?”, separating the feeling of certainty from evidence, treating attention like a budget, and remembering that persuasion is not the same as understanding.

These are not romantic skills. They are janitorial. Which is why they matter.

The Vedic prayer asks to be led from darkness to light. Fine. But in practical terms, light comes from wiring, maintenance, and someone paying the electricity bill. There is no metaphysical shortcut around the boring parts.

I confess I often want the shortcut anyway. I want my life to be redeemed by a clever paragraph, by a brilliant insight, by one perfect explanation that rearranges my neurons and suddenly makes me industrious, calm, and unafraid.

That desire is itself a kind of superstition.

## Where It Lands, For Now

Late afternoon shifts. The sun angle changes and the bamboo’s shadow lengthens, making it look, briefly, like it is still something coherent—still a pole, still a tool, still a thing with a job. Shadows are generous that way. They lie with elegance.

I stand there with my phone in my hand, the modern rosary, and feel the tug to turn this scene into content, into performance, into one more little offering to the digital sewer. I also feel the opposite tug: to do something stubbornly physical, small, unshareable, almost private.

So I pick up the bamboo. It crackles. It falls apart a bit more, offended by being handled. The pieces are light, surprisingly—strength lost its density when it left. I gather some of the small splinters into a rough pile. I don’t feel noble. I feel like a man cleaning his own mess, which is the least poetic form of redemption available. Of course it's still a mess, it would need a crew of concerted concerned men to clean the rooftop from the accumulated high entropy. 

Time eats everything. Fine. Let it eat. But it doesn’t get to eat *for free*. Not entirely. Not without me occasionally refusing the easy slide—closing the feed, resisting the automatic click, doing the small maintenance that keeps a mind from rotting into confetti.

I brush the dust off my hands. I look once more at the rooftop stain where the bamboo lay, that pale ghost-shape of absence. Then I turn off the screen for a minute, just long enough to hear the city’s real hum—distant horns, a bird arguing with nothing, the faint domestic clatter of survival—and I let the silence do what it does best: remind me that the world is indifferent, yes, but not imaginary.
