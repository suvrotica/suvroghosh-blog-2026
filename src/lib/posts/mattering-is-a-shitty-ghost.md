The smell came first, always does, that warm iron-and-ammonia tang that rises from a Calcutta latrine at dawn, when the city is still half-asleep and the shit hasn’t yet been trampled into modernity by a million sandals, and I’m squatting there with my knees creaking like colonial furniture, anus hovering over a porcelain bowl that has seen more despair than any philosopher, phone in one hand, cock useless and dangling like a sad afterthought, and my brain—this treacherous sack of electrified tapioca—whispering its daily sermon: you do not matter, you have never mattered, you will never matter, now push.

Sometimes the shit comes easily, a sloppy brown resignation letter from the body to the day ahead.
Sometimes it clings.
Today it clung, like meaning.

I have bipolar depression and anxiety, which sounds dramatic until you realize it mostly means lying on a bed staring at a fan, masturbating without enthusiasm, and inventing reasons why everything feels like a cunt punt to the soul. The psychiatrists love neurotransmitters because neurotransmitters don’t argue back, but I know a story when I see one, and my head is stuffed with them, childhood fables about destiny and worth and being special, fed to me like sweetened condensed milk until my teeth rotted with expectation. Somewhere in there, lodged like a turd that refuses to flush, is the idea that I am supposed to matter.

Mattering.
What a ridiculous word.
Sounds like battering something with meaning until it submits.

The brain, from what the nerds say, has this thing called the default mode network, which is a fancy way of saying the mind’s gossip aunt who never shuts the fuck up, constantly narrating, constantly looping back to me-me-me, replaying humiliations like a highlight reel no one asked for. It’s the part of the brain that turns a bad bowel movement into a referendum on your existence. It’s not a physical organ you can cut out with a scalpel, which is unfortunate because I would gladly rent one for the afternoon, but a psychological fiction, a story-generator with IBS.

I read somewhere—because of course I did—that happiness is sometimes just the absence of that narrator, a brief electrical silence where the self fucks off for a cigarette. I remember this from Ambien nights, those soporific holidays where the brain loosens its grip and you feel oddly buoyant, detached, even joyful, while brushing your teeth with shaving cream or texting an ex about the metaphysics of tits. Chemical amnesia as grace. Proof that the self is optional, like underwear at home.

But when the drug wears off, there’s the rent.
And the books.

I want to buy a book by Rebecca Goldstein about meaning, because apparently when your life feels like a stalled auto-rickshaw belching fumes, you’re supposed to consult philosophers, as if Plato ever had to choose between lithium and groceries. I’m an atheist Bengali rotting in the boondocks of Calcutta, which is a sentence that already feels like a punchline written by a cruel god I don’t believe in, and my grand spiritual practice is listening to smart people and reading books I can barely afford. Below the bread line, even by third world standards, which is impressive in the same way having the smallest dick at the orgy would be impressive if anyone were keeping score.

Books are all I spend on.
No travel.
No restaurants.
No joy accessories.

If you visited me on a random day, you’d see a middle-aged middle-class nonentity, no one, surrounded by stacks of paperbacks like a failed fortification, struggling to read them because depression turns paragraphs into mud. A man with more spines than prospects. I sit there, ass imprinting the bed, flipping pages slowly, the way old men chew, as if savoring the last calories of relevance.

Science tells us the brain is a prediction machine, constantly guessing the next moment, and depression is when every prediction is shit. The body believes the future will hurt, so it prepares by hurting now. Anxiety is the same asshole, just caffeinated. Evolutionarily, this made sense when tigers were involved. Now the tiger is an unpaid electricity bill and a book you want but can’t buy.

Colonialism fucked us in many ways, but one of its quieter crimes was teaching us that ideas come wrapped in imported paper, that meaning arrives via hardback from elsewhere, footnoted and authoritative. So here I am, counting coins like a Victorian orphan, trying to decide whether I can afford a paperback on why I matter, which is objectively hilarious. Paying to be told you exist. Capitalism really will sell you your own reflection if you’re lonely enough.

The body, meanwhile, has its own opinions.
It wants to piss.
It wants to shit.
It wants, occasionally, to fuck, in that dull, stubborn way that feels less like desire and more like a system error.

Abstract concepts like meaning are just bodily urges in drag. You want significance the way your colon wants release: pressure builds, discomfort rises, and eventually something has to give. Philosophers dress it up in Greek, but it’s the same plumbing. When the shit won’t come, you feel wrong. When life won’t make sense, same feeling, different hole.

I keep thinking if I can just understand the mechanism—if I can map the neural circuitry of this me-me loop, annotate it like a bad diagram—I can slip out of it. But knowledge is a tease. You can know the biochemistry of desire and still get a pointless hard-on on a crowded bus, trying to hide it behind a bag of onions while pretending to be fascinated by traffic.

Politics says I should matter as a citizen.
Religion says I should matter to god.
Family says I should matter because blood.
The market says I matter only if I produce.

All of them can eat my ass.

The left promised meaning through solidarity, then got lost in slogans. Nationalism promised belonging, then demanded my brain as collateral. Masculinity promised power, then handed me a limp script written by dead men. Spirituality promised transcendence, then asked for my credit card. Every system wants to rent space in your default mode network and run ads.

Sometimes, late afternoon, when the heat presses down like a fat relative, I lie there thinking maybe meaning is just a side effect, like nausea, something you don’t chase but tolerate when it shows up. The happiest moments I remember are stupid ones: a perfectly timed fart in an empty room, the clean click of a switch, the sudden relief after a long-held piss that makes you shiver and sigh like you’ve just solved a theorem.

Maybe mattering is the wrong unit.
Maybe sensation is enough.

But then the narrator kicks in again, that internal cunt with a clipboard, tallying failures, comparing me to imaginary versions of myself who did better, fucked more, published something, mattered. The body answers by sinking, by making gravity feel personal. Depression is gravity with an opinion.

I imagine buying the book. I imagine the cover in my hands, the smell of fresh paper, the tiny dopamine hit of ownership. I imagine underlining a sentence and thinking, yes, that’s it, that’s the key, while my stomach growls because I skipped lunch to afford it. Knowledge has always been my cheapest drug, but it still costs.

Outside, the city groans. Somewhere, someone is praying loudly. Somewhere else, someone is fucking. The sewer gurgles like it’s thinking about philosophy. I get up to piss again, because the body doesn’t care about narratives. The stream is weak, hesitant, middle-aged. I watch it, hypnotized, thinking about flow states and Buddhist emptiness and how none of it stops urine from splashing back on your toes if the angle’s wrong.

I return to the bed, books staring at me like disappointed teachers. I pick one up, read a page, forget it, read it again. The brain resists meaning the way a constipated asshole resists fiber. Somewhere in the circuits, the self is still chattering, still insisting it deserves a plot.

Night comes.
The fan ticks.
The body wants sleep, then doesn’t.

I think about mattering the way I think about my dick now: something that once promised a future and now mostly gets in the way. I pull the blanket up, feel a half-erection rise and fall for no reason, a pointless salute to nothing. There is no redemption in it, just biology misfiring in the dark.

Tomorrow I might have enough money for the book.
Tomorrow I might not.

For now, I lie there, listening to my stomach bubble, the city breathe, the default mode network mutter its bullshit, and I wonder if this is what existing amounts to: a damp room, a restless brain, a body leaking quietly, trying very hard not to believe its own stories.
