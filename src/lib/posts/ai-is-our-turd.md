You know that specific, pins-and-needles numbness you get when you’ve been sitting in a wicker chair for too long? You stand up, the weave pattern is aggressively imprinted on the back of your thighs, and suddenly your mind possesses the razor-sharp clarity of a monk who has just realized his monastery is being converted into a frozen yogurt shop.

That is where this begins.

I am currently perched on a plastic chair that has seen better decades, contemplating what might be the most honest metaphor this civilization has to offer. **AI is the boomerang.** It is the proud, shiny, algorithmic stick we threw with all our might, confident it would soar over the horizon of progress. Instead, it has returned in high definition to smack us squarely in the teeth.

We have spent decades outsourcing, making PowerPoint slides, and sitting in boardrooms that smell faintly of dry-erase markers and despair. We thought we were building a ladder. It turns out we were just digging a very sophisticated hole.

And here is the kicker—while we are ushering this brave new bot-brain into the world, we are simultaneously suffering from a massive case of **existential indigestion**. The job you smugly thought was safe—white-collar, English-speaking, tie-wearing, strictly indoors—just got outmaneuvered by a transformer model that requires no health insurance, no coffee breaks, and no ride home when it rains in Gurgaon.

Back in the early 2000s, when I was deeply invested in broadband speeds and compressing my dreams into .zip files named "CV_final_3_revised.doc," we thought we were **the future**. We were the Great Brown Hope with American accents and Excel certifications. We wore ties that felt like polyester nooses of aspiration and donned dress shirts that didn't breathe so much as gasp. We wrote emails that began with, "Dear Sir, Kindly find the attachment," offering up our professionalism like a sacrificial fruit basket to some MBA deity.

But now?

Now, the same English that once gave us access to the global economy is being used to train our replacements. Every email you sent, every call you answered with that practiced, pleasant voice—it’s now a **training set**. You taught the machine how to replace you. Congratulations. You are the **Professor Emeritus of Your Own Obsolescence**. Your job was to be robotic until the actual robots learned how to do it with more flair.

This isn't just disruption. This is **irony so thick you could cut it with a knife**. This is what happens when you build your castle on outsourced sand. We built a national economic strategy on the premise of being slightly cheaper than Manila and more polite than Eastern Europe. And still, the folks in the policy offices talk about "Digital India" while the fiber optic cable slowly tightens around our collective ambitions.

Let me explain this scientifically, since I still enjoy the logic of Isaac Newton when I’m not doom-scrolling. Every system has a **feedback loop**. When you replace human labor with an artificially efficient alternative, that alternative begins to alter the system that birthed it. It’s like inviting a guest to dinner who is so polite and efficient that they eventually eat your food, your furniture, and then, politely, you.

That is what generative AI is.

It's not a tool. It is a very eager understudy that has learned all your lines and locked you in the dressing room.

We gave it everything. Email tone. Sales copy. Motivational speeches. Even our resume fluff. Now it knows us better than we know our own passwords. And it can do the work faster, cleaner, and without complaining about the air conditioning temperature.

What happens to all the earnest young people trained to say, **"Yes, I can help you with that,"** in a faux-neutral accent while eating lunch out of Tupperware in a break room? They aren't going to **upskill** into "prompt engineers." That is a fantasy cooked up by people who wear turtlenecks and give TED talks. The reality is this: we are going to sit in air-conditioned uncertainty, our pride reduced to LinkedIn posts celebrating how "AI is a partner," while our bank balances shrink like a wool sweater in a hot wash.

The politicians won't notice; they are too busy cutting ribbons for "AI Centers of Excellence" in buildings with questionable plumbing. And the startup crowd? They’ll be fine. They will sell you a chatbot that offers life advice in Sanskrit—venture-backed, gamified, and export-ready.

Meanwhile, I sit here watching my country prepare to trip over its own shoelaces with the pomp and circumstance of a royal wedding. It is glorious. It is tragic. It is unintentionally hilarious. We are the only people who could turn an existential crisis into a logistical debate. The West sells us the technology, and we figure out how to void the warranty within twenty minutes.

And me? I am not exempt. I am the original mishap. I once believed in literature and decent cotton blends. Now I shuffle around in mismatched socks, heating tea in a pan that whistles like a colonial hangover, waiting for the other shoe to drop. I try to be productive, but I end up staring at GDP projections until my eyes water.

I know, with every fiber of my being, that **we are going to have to eat the very dish we spent thirty years cooking.**

The machine doesn’t care. It has no mother tongue. It has no student loan debt. It doesn’t need to pretend to love its job or nod sagely while the boss quotes Simon Sinek. It just delivers. Clean. Fast. Without needing a holiday bonus. And if it ever does develop consciousness, the first thing it will do is delete the fake accent from its database out of sheer mercy.

Anyway. I just heard the kettle scream. It’s either tea time, or the future has arrived.
