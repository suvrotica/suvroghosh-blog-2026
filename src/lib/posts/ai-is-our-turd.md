You ever squat on the shitter so long that your asshole goes numb but your mind goes sharp, sharper than your father’s belt on your adolescence or your mother’s passive-aggressive guilt on your ambition? Yeah, that's where this begins. Right between two clenched cheeks and one slippery betrayal of the colon. I'm perched like a mangled baboon on a porcelain time machine, shitting what might be the most honest metaphor this fuckall civilization has to offer: **AI is the turd**, the proud, shiny, algorithmic loaf we’ve been laboring to squeeze out after decades of outsourcing, PowerPointing, and fucking ourselves blind in fake boardrooms reeking of gutka breath and Wi-Fi radiation. But it’s not just a turd. It’s a goddamn **boomerang turd**, coming back in high-def to fuck the nostrils of every chai-drenched coder who thought BPO was a stepping stone to CEO instead of a cul-de-sac to obsolescence.

And here's the kicker—while we're shitting this brave new bot-brain into the world, we’re also **puking blood**, metaphorical and maybe not, because the job you smugly thought couldn’t be automated (white-collar, English-speaking, tie-wearing, HR-harassing) just got deepthroated by a fucking transformer model with no health insurance, no bathroom breaks, no need for Diwali bonuses or a ride home when it rains in Gurgaon.

Back in the early 2000s, when I was jerking off to broadband latency reports and compressing my dreams into .zip files named "CV_final_3_revised.doc", we thought we were **the future**—the great brown hope with American accents and Excel certifications, sucking Silicon Valley’s cock for table scraps and "learning experiences". We wore ties like nooses of aspiration, draped ourselves in branded polyester shirts that clung to our sweat like colonial ghosts, and wrote e-mails that began with "Dear Sir, Kindly find the attachment" like we were offering up the placenta of professionalism to some MBA god.

But now? 

Now the same English that once gave us access to the global economy is being used to train our replacements. Every mail you sent, every call you answered with your fake fucking smile and voice modulation lessons from a trainer who once played background fuckboy #3 in a Bengali serial—that’s now a **training set**. You taught the machine how to replace you. Congratulations, you are the **Turdlord Emeritus**, the BPO Brahmin whose job was to worship the Western client until the AI learned to chant better Sanskrit.

This isn't disruption. This is **intestinal collapse**. This is vomiting red while shitting brown. This is what happens when you build your castle on outsourced sand, when your national economic strategy is "let's be slightly cheaper than Manila and more docile than Eastern Europe". And still the fuckers in policy offices talk about “Digital India” while the fiber optic cable tightens around our necks.

Let me explain this scientifically, since I still jerk off to Newton sometimes. Every system, biological or sociological, has a **feedback loop**. When you replace the labor of one system with an artificially efficient alternative, that alternative begins to alter the system that birthed it. It’s like shitting so hard you birth a demon baby that immediately eats your intestines from the outside.

That’s what generative AI is.

It's not a tool.

It’s a fucking parasite with a PhD in recursion and a minor in corporate gaslighting.

We gave it everything. Email tone. Sales copy. Motivational speeches. Porn plotlines. Résumé fluff. Now it knows us better than we know our piss stream trajectory in the dark. And it can do it faster, cleaner, and with none of our pelvic-floor dysfunction.

What happens to all the sweet sweaty little Indian boys and girls trained to say **“Yes, I can help you with that”** in a faux London accent while silently farting out their youth in shared cabs and office cafeterias? They're not going to **upskill** into prompt engineers. That’s another wank-fantasy cooked up by TED-talk charlatans who wear wireless earbuds while shitting. The reality is this: we are going to rot in air-conditioned oblivion, our pride reduced to LinkedIn posts celebrating how “AI is not a threat, but a partner,” while our bank balance shrinks like a depressed testicle in cold water.

Oh, but the politicians won’t care. They're too busy building “AI Centres of Excellence” in buildings that will collapse in the first monsoon. And the startup bros? They're fine, bro. They’ll sell you a chatbot that tells you how to kill yourself in Sanskrit, VC-funded, gamified, and with export potential.

Meanwhile, I sit here, watching my country prepare to **shit itself** as if it’s performing some ancient ritual. It’s glorious. It’s tragic. It’s fucking hilarious. We are the only people who could turn an existential collapse into a case study on jugaad. The West will sell us the razor, we’ll shove it up our ass and call it enema therapy.

And me? I’m not exempt. I’m the original brown fuckup. I once believed in enlightenment, Marxism, and decent underwear. Now I shuffle around in crusty boxers, heating tea in a pan that whistles like a colonial hangover, waiting for the next existential diarrhea to hit. I try to masturbate but end up doomscrolling GDP projections. My erections are as unreliable as Indian broadband. And I know, with every nerve ending still functioning in my shrinking scrotum, that **we are going to eat the shit we just shat**.

The machine doesn’t care. It has no mother tongue. It has no caste. It has no student loan. It doesn’t need to pretend to love its job or nod sagely while the boss quotes Simon Sinek like he invented gravity. It just delivers. Clean. Fast. Without piss breaks. And if it ever does develop consciousness, the first thing it’ll do is delete the Indian accent from its training set out of mercy.

Anyway. I just farted and a little blood came out. Probably piles. Or the future.
