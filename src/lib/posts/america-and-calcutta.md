In America the air always felt pre-filtered, not clean exactly, just processed, as if someone had run the outdoors through a corporate committee and removed the more opinionated molecules, and you could step into a grocery store at 2 a.m. under lights so bright they seemed to have personal grudges, the floor polished into a kind of sterile moonlight, the aisles laid out like a military plan—cereal in battalions, milk in chilled trenches—everything wrapped, labeled, and barcoded, the entire edible world turned into rectangles with nutrition facts and the faint chemical perfume of plastic and refrigeration.

The soundscape was mostly absence. The hum of HVAC. The distant rush of a highway. The occasional siren that felt like a scheduled event. Even the birds sounded like they’d been told to keep it down. The great American miracle is not freedom; it’s insulation—double-glazed windows, central air, cars that seal you off from weather and strangers and smell itself, an entire civilization built around the idea that the body is an inconvenience that should be soothed, refrigerated, and moved around in padded silence.

Calcutta begins by contradicting that. Calcutta does not insulate you; it introduces you. The air has a personality and it wants to talk. It smells like wet earth after a sudden shower, then immediately like frying oil, then like old brick sweating in humidity, then like a drain that has given up believing in tomorrow. There is incense somewhere, always, not because anyone is particularly holy but because smoke is our default interface with the unseen—mosquitoes, gods, other people’s cooking, history. Your nostrils learn to do what American zoning laws do: partition reality into tolerable neighborhoods.

In America, technology is everywhere and rarely visible. It hides in drywall and chipsets and app updates that happen while you sleep. You forget the infrastructure until it fails, and when it fails, it apologizes in a calm voice and gives you an estimated time of restoration, like a butler with a clipboard. Power is so reliable you can treat it like gravity. Water arrives silently and leaves silently. Garbage disappears. The city performs competence with such consistency that you start believing competence is the natural state of matter.

Calcutta’s technology is loud, exposed, improvisational—less like an invisible nervous system and more like a set of patched organs you can see beating. Wires sag like old vines. Generators cough to life with the enthusiasm of reluctant buffaloes. The UPS beeps its little electronic lament, a sound that has become part of modern Bengali domestic music, right up there with pressure cookers and distant arguments. The city does not hide its maintenance; it lives in it. A man is always fixing something. Another man is always watching him fix it. A third man is always offering unsolicited expertise, which is our true renewable resource.

In America, the car is the great sensory editor. You glide. You commute through climate-controlled sameness: strip malls, parking lots, polite signage, the soft tyranny of lanes. You can drive for hours and your skin barely knows you moved. The roads speak in reflective paint and predictable rules. Even danger has a kind of decorum—crumple zones, airbags, insurance forms that arrive like legal haikus.

In Calcutta, the street is not a corridor; it’s a parliament. It smells of diesel and dust and jhalmuri masala and damp newspapers and human sweat and marigold garlands and the faint metallic tang of tram lines. The honking is not “noise,” it’s a language: short beep for “I exist,” longer beep for “I will now violate geometry,” angry beep for “I regret your birth,” the occasional melodious horn that sounds like a toy and therefore a philosophical statement. The road is an argument you participate in with your body. You are never merely transported; you are negotiated.

America has a particular scent that I only noticed after leaving: carpet shampoo, dryer sheets, gasoline that smells oddly sweet, and the cold breath of air conditioning. Summer smells like cut grass and sunscreen. Winter smells like nothing. Homes smell like laundry and microwaved food and the faint plastic warmth of electronics. Everything is designed to not smell too much, because smell implies biology, and biology implies mess, and mess implies someone might have to admit they are an animal.

Calcutta smells like animals because it is honest about being alive. It smells like fish markets at dawn—the briny slap of hilsa and rohu laid out like damp jewels—like hot asphalt after rain, like paraffin from cheap candles during load-shedding, like wet wool in monsoon, like the sour-sweet breath of a crowded bus, like old books in College Street that have absorbed generations of fingers and mildew and ambition. Sometimes it smells like jasmine and sandalwood and frying luchi and you remember the city can be tender. Sometimes it smells like rot and you remember tenderness is not a municipal guarantee.

Even time behaves differently. In America, time is sliced into appointments and deadlines that land with the precision of rockets. Buses come when they are supposed to. Elevators arrive like obedient servants. You can plan your day as if the universe respects calendars. In Calcutta, time is more biological—subject to weather, traffic, power, moods, strikes, weddings, a sudden procession, a politician’s whim. Schedules are aspirations. The city does not so much run on time as wrestle with it.

And yet the strangest contrast—at least to my overeducated, underpaid brain—is what each place does to your inner monologue. America made me quieter. It gave my thoughts a clean room. With fewer sensory ambushes, the mind becomes an office: efficient, lonely, well-lit. Calcutta makes me noisy inside because it is noisy outside. You can’t separate the self from the street. Your thoughts are always taking interruptions. A horn cuts into a sentence. A vendor’s call becomes a footnote. A neighbor’s argument becomes a subplot. Even solitude here has background characters.

The American night is a controlled darkness—suburbs dimmed into tasteful safety, streetlights laid out like a grid of modest stars, the occasional howl of a distant train that seems almost decorative. Calcutta’s night is not dark; it’s dimly awake. There’s a television bleeding through a window. A dog barking at nothing specific. The hiss of frying oil somewhere. The occasional shout that could be laughter or rage—sometimes both. And when the power goes, the city doesn’t become silent; it becomes intimate, lit by phone screens and emergency bulbs, with the air suddenly louder because the fans have stopped.

I don’t mean this as a simple complaint or a simple romance. America is not soulless; it’s just engineered to reduce friction, and friction is where your senses live. Calcutta is not chaotic by nature; it’s just under-maintained in ways that force humans to do the buffering, and humans are unreliable, emotional, loud, sometimes brilliant, often exhausted.

America felt like a machine that worked. Calcutta feels like a machine that argues with you while it works.

Somewhere in that difference is my entire nervous system, still toggling between climates, still remembering the smell of air-conditioned cardboard boxes in a Texas Walmart and the smell of wet jute sacks in a North Calcutta godown, still trying to decide which one is “normal,” as if normal is anything more than what your lungs get used to.

In Calcutta a Bengali can be magnificently non-stick—slipping through obligations like a practiced escape artist—because the city itself supplies community by force: relatives within shouting range, paras that function like low-grade surveillance states, and strangers who feel entitled to your biography; but in America the same Bengali, abruptly de-embedded and left standing alone with a mortgage, snow tires, and the terrifying silence of “privacy,” becomes a creature of urgent clustering, herding toward any familiar vowel the way filings rush a magnet, building archipelagos of potlucks, Durga Puja committees that recreate the entire Bengali political ecosystem inside a rented school gym, and weekend adda that begins as “just chai” and ends in arguments about Tagore and property taxes—while the ABCD children orbit this universe like mildly embarrassed moons, insisting on pizza with the grim certainty of people defending a citizenship, pronouncing *phuchka* as if it’s a medical condition, treating shorshe ilish like an exotic dare, and yet still somehow absorbing the herd instinct in secret, because even when they roll their eyes at the mishti doi and the endless auntie interrogations, they know—on some cellular level—that in a country built for individualism, you survive by manufacturing a small, noisy, overfeeding version of home.

I don’t miss America as much as I miss the me in America—the version of myself who moved through wide, obedient spaces like a man temporarily upgraded, who could plan a day without first consulting the gods of traffic and power supply, who breathed air that didn’t feel like it had been pre-chewed by a million exhaust pipes, who walked into a library or a supermarket under those bright, merciless lights and felt—briefly, absurdly—like the world had been engineered for competence and therefore maybe I could be competent too; I miss the quiet confidence that came from reliable infrastructure, the strange dignity of being left alone, the way my thoughts in that sterile American silence could line up like well-behaved schoolchildren instead of jostling like passengers on a Howrah local, and I miss the particular illusion you get when everything works—that you are not exactly happier, but you are less interrupted, less eroded, less forced to negotiate your own existence at every step—until you come back here and realize you weren’t missing a country so much as missing a nervous system that had, for a while, stopped being on permanent alert.

My current reality is not as roomy as all things Texan, but a smaller, tighter ecology: a rented flat in the shanty boondocks of South Calcutta where parsimony isn’t a virtue you perform, it’s the physics of the habitat, the way a lizard survives on a wall by spending nothing it doesn’t have to; I live now with mostly the minimum—mattress on the floor, a few stubborn books that outlast regimes, a rice cooker that behaves more reliably than most institutions, a kettle and tea, a water bottle parked like a sentinel at night, an old laptop and my Samsung tablet glowing like a domestic hearth—and the whole place feels like a reduced model of life, stripped of the decorative lies, tuned for endurance rather than flourish, where even desire has to queue up and justify itself, and where the invisibility matters as much as the objects: being unnoticed, un-summoned, not constantly forced into other people’s weather is the one condition that seems to keep my brittle bipolar inner self quietly corrected, not cured—nothing so dramatic—but steadied, as if isolation is a kind of splint, a way of letting the mind’s hairline fractures knit in peace without the chemical scaffolding of medication, while the city outside honks and leaks and argues with the future.
