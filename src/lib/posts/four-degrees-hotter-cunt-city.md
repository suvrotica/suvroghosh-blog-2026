There’s something uniquely fucking humiliating about sweat pooling in the folds between your sagging belly and your half-deflated balls, like a stale gravy of salt and despair fermenting quietly in the crease of the universe that no God has visited since the Cambrian explosion.

I'm not talking about sweat like in a gym ad, where the glistening drop seductively rolls down the sculpted nipple of some tank-top twat doing crunches. No. I’m talking glacial runoff from your own fucking body, Suvro-style, the tragic dripping faucet of a middle-aged brown cunt in Calcutta, trapped in a concrete box that’s now technically part of Earth’s new experimental climate sauna project, brought to you by the fossil fuel industry and every dickless bureaucrat that ever attended a COP conference with a lanyard and an erection for panel discussions.

Four degrees.

That’s the number, the punchline, the death rattle. Four fucking degrees Celsius, like Nature’s version of a passive-aggressive ex who doesn’t even bother to yell anymore, just turns the dial slightly and watches you suffer. And suffer you do. I do. My flat does. My inverter AC, which was already a gasping wheeze-box of secondhand hope from Flipkart’s Diwali sale, now clicks and groans like it’s dying in Morse code. It manages to cool the air directly in front of it, yes, but only by converting the rest of the goddamn flat into a kiln for slow-roasting the unemployed.

They said—whoever “they” are, always those unseen assholes with TED Talks and acronyms—they said four degrees would flood cities, ruin crops, ignite ecosystems like joints in the hands of white boys at Burning Man. But they didn’t say anything about the *smell*. The street after 11am now reeks like a communal fart stuck in a wet sock—plastic, meat, mildew, diesel, jhaalar oil, and the thick musk of humans decaying while still technically alive. Everyone's rotting. Even the trees seem to want to fuck off and die.

Some mornings I sit by the window, naked except for a lungi tied in that half-surrendered way that’s not so much tied as draped in pity, watching the sweating plastic tub on my balcony fill with rainwater that sizzles on contact with the asbestos railing like acid on a dead pig. The sky is not a sky anymore. It’s a lid. A greasy, low, sweaty lid trapping all our collective farts, ambitions, and viral load beneath it like a Tupperware you forgot in the fridge for six months.

And the pigeons. Holy cockpecking Christ, the pigeons. They’re fucking like investment bankers in a bull market, but louder and with more visible genital engagement. Even they seem too hot, too horny, too stupid to stop. One flew into my fan the other day and exploded like a feathered meat grenade. I didn’t even clean it. Just watched the ants arrive in a phalanx and saluted their work ethic.

But we deserve this, don’t we? We, the clever monkeyfuckers who traded the ozone for a couple decades of air-conditioned malls and YouTube. We, who let climate change become a footnote in WhatsApp university while our politicians measured GDP by how much concrete you could dump on a rice field. Four degrees is not some theoretical tick in a PowerPoint. It’s a full-body experience, like being licked by Satan’s dick while someone pours boiling piss into your armpits.

It’s August in January.

It's 39°C at midnight, and I can’t decide whether to shit, cry, or microwave my own head. My skin has developed these curious new micro-rashes that map, in fine detail, the exact locations where sweat gets trapped between folds of unlovable meat. My balls now stick to my thigh like clingfilm to a leftover roti. I tried talcum powder. It just formed a paste. A paste. I invented a new geological stratum under my scrotum.

And inside the fridge—which, by the way, has now become just a dimly lit cupboard that hums out of guilt—the milk turns in less than a day. Tomatoes melt. Bananas ferment into suicidal liquor. I bit into a mango last week and the fucker fizzed. Carbonated fruit, bitches. The Anthropocene’s cocktail menu.

And because this is Calcutta, even hell has bureaucracy. The local power cuts still follow their old logic, as if climate collapse were just another summer inconvenience. Two hours gone here, three hours there, and no one even bothers to complain anymore. My neighbor’s inverter battery literally caught fire. The fire brigade came late, because one of their guys had fainted inside the truck. Heatstroke. Inside the truck.

Oh, and the sex dreams. Heat does something to your brainstem. I keep dreaming about exes I haven’t seen since Vajpayee was PM, and they all have new sweaty, horrible demands. One wants me to lick sunscreen off her back while she reads out the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report. One demands I fuck her under a solar panel that keeps shorting out. One just sits on my face and cries about the Maldives being underwater. I wake up soaked, hard, and furious.

Of course, nobody gives a flying titfuck about Calcutta in the climate narrative. We’re not New York. We’re not Venice. We’re not even fucking Jakarta. We’re the appendix of the subcontinent, already half-digested and ignored, where heat death is just another item in the daily news, right after the part where someone was crushed under a billboard and a goat gave birth to a three-headed disappointment. So when four degrees comes to visit, it doesn’t come with headlines or Netflix documentaries. It comes with dengue, sewer gas, and men in banyans drinking warm Bournvita in alleyways filled with mosquitoes that now have AI.

It comes with old women sitting on tiled verandas, fanning themselves with torn paper calendars and muttering about how Durga Puja used to be cooler, in temperature and morality. It comes with boys sniffing glue in stairwells, because all the AC cinema halls have become refugee camps for upper-caste influencers. It comes with me, typing this on a laptop that’s too hot for my thighs, naked below the waist, and slowly becoming one with the plastic chair beneath me.

Four degrees is not a future. It’s a body state.

It’s my thigh rash. My fridge smell. My air conditioner’s death rattle. My inability to ejaculate without hallucinating a drowning rhinoceros.

It’s the sound of my sweat dripping on the floor and forming the word *“fuck”* in slow, salty calligraphy.
