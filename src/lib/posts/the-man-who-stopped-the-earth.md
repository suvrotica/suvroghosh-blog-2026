Kolkata is accustomed to oddities. The streets here are layered thick with the handbills of politicians, philosophers, and mystics, a papier-mâché geology of promises and revolutions. But perhaps no voice has been as persistently idiosyncratic as that of Kartick Chandra Paul.

Paul is a graffitist less Banksy than Bruno, a man who turned the city's cracked walls into his personal blackboards for an eccentric cosmological declaration: the Earth stands still, and the Sun, contrarily, completes its yearly circumambulation around our world. To him, Galileo and Copernicus were not enlightened scientists but misguided navigators steering humanity away from cosmic truth.

# The Soldier at Fatehgarh

The etymology of "graffiti"—from the Italian *graffiare*, "to scratch"—encapsulates Paul’s approach perfectly. He spent decades inscribing vehement challenges to heliocentrism directly into the physical fabric of Kolkata.



The genesis of this obsession was not in a classroom, but under the open skies of Fatehgarh. Born in 1942 near Howrah, Paul joined the Indian Army as a young man. Stationed beneath the expansive canopy of the night, he fixated upon the seemingly stationary positions of the North Star (*Polaris*) and Venus. He concluded, against the weight of four centuries of Copernican orthodoxy, that if Earth were truly spinning and orbiting at breakneck speeds, these celestial anchors would betray our movement.

They didn't move (to his eye), therefore we didn't move. It was a deduction of startling, simplistic purity. Upon his discharge in 1979—officially for insubordination linked to his unorthodox scientific fervor—he took his battle to the streets.

# Defying the Equations

Paul’s sprawling, hand-painted manifestos bear messages like “The Sun goes around the Earth once in a year, hence seasons change.” He makes no apologies for lacking rigorous mathematical derivation; to Paul, intuitive observation and relentless conviction suffice.

He brushes aside Kepler’s laws of planetary motion, specifically the third law which relates orbital periods to distance:

$$
T^2 \propto a^3
$$

Where $T$ is the orbital period and $a$ is the semi-major axis. Paul is equally unimpressed by Newtonian gravitation, which describes the force ($F$) that keeps planets in those orbits:

$$
F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}
$$

To Paul, the fact that gravity weakens by the square of the distance ($r^2$) is irrelevant if it contradicts the evidence of his own feet. The Earth does not move, he argues, for if it did, we would surely feel it. It is a logic that is strictly empirical, deeply intuitive, and scientifically unmoored.

# The Geocentric Heretic

Paul embodies a singularly human paradox—he is simultaneously Galileo’s interrogator and Galileo himself. Like the famous Italian, he is a heretic standing against the consensus of his time. But unlike Galileo, he is fighting *for* the ancient past, resonating faint echoes of Aristotelian spheres and Ptolemaic epicycles.

Ptolemy, in 2nd century Alexandria, used complex loops (epicycles) to explain why planets seemed to move backward (retrograde) if they were orbiting Earth. Paul’s graffiti evokes these complexities without the math, driven by a sheer poetic tenacity.

Like Giordano Bruno, who burnt at the stake in 1600 for defending an infinite cosmos, Paul defends his inverse proposition with the same fire. Yet Paul’s fire remains metaphorical: a quiet inferno of words and white paint on the alley walls of North Kolkata.

At once hero, eccentric, and cautionary tale, Kartick Chandra Paul remains resolute. He brushes against the relentless march of scientific consensus, his inscriptions fading and reappearing like tides, resolutely geocentric in a heliocentric world.
