It starts, as it often does, with a fart—not a literal one this time, no glorious trumpet squeal from the hairy cusp of my reluctant arsehole, not the satisfying pelvic pop of a good sit-down release after misjudged street momo with a side of unrefrigerated chutney, no, not even the faint hissing coward fart of a man who's trying to ghost out his sins behind a whirring ceiling fan while squatting on a plastic chair in his underpants—but the mental equivalent, a moist, shapeless, undignified *thought-fart*, bubbling up from the sulphur pit of my skull where neurons spark like panicked rats chewing through electric wires in a godforsaken, underfunded Calcutta data center.

And you want me to be *coherent*?

Let me draw you a motherfucking map of the terrain I’m expected to cross with my thoughts, which, mind you, are not noble, clean, linear, logical things like in the retellings of TED Talks or masturbatory Western productivity blogs. No, mine are mangled, dripping, half-formed dysenteric things that ooze out sideways from my basal ganglia like old toothpaste from a war-worn tube with no cap, festering behind the sink in a rented flat where the exhaust fan hasn’t worked since the Vajpayee administration.

I sit there, in my boxers, thighs stuck to fake leather, keyboard clacking with the uncertain rhythm of a man trying to figure out if he’s writing or just moving fingers to simulate life.

Here’s what coherence is supposed to do: pull a rabbit out of a hat, but in my case, the hat is made of wet cardboard, and the rabbit is a bipolar mongoose with rabies, and also it’s invisible. The very *source* of my thoughts, if you will, the subterranean glandular soup from which so-called reason emerges, is like trying to filter a single grain of rice from a Kolkata municipal drain during monsoon. You’re welcome to try. Bring gloves. And tetanus shots.

Now stack on top of that the fucking ocean of my moods, which is less an ocean and more a sewage backup in a theme park—one moment I’m fine, I’m calculating Pi to a hundred digits and telling myself I might still be useful, and the next I’m trying to remember if I brushed my teeth yesterday or if that burning sensation is just depression with halitosis. These aren’t moods, they’re *weather systems*, violent pressure differentials slamming into the tectonic sadness of my daily life with the sonic boom of a thousand disappointed erections. And in the middle of this, I’m supposed to form a "topic"?

Good luck. Good fucking luck.

I once read—probably in one of those overpriced pop-sci fuckbooks with shiny covers and no index—that neuroscientists try to *map the brain*, that elusive fucker, using an fMRI, and I laughed so hard a booger shot out of my left nostril and landed on a page about the default mode network. Because here’s what fMRI actually does: it takes a picture of your brain being a gossipy little bitch.

See, the technology is essentially a nosy aunty with a stethoscope, sitting in the MRI control room, eavesdropping on the weak-ass radio signals emitted by those thirsty little hydrogen ions in your blood. And those fuckers? They align when you stick them in a big-ass magnet (and I do mean *big*—these magnets are the size of minor religious monuments), and then, once aligned like good little soldiers, you hit them with a radio wave that makes them jitter and come unhinged, and when they fall back into line (like every Bengali husband after shouting at his wife in public), they leak a tiny signal.

That’s it. That’s your fMRI.

A glorified blood-watching tool.

It doesn’t even see *neurons*, the main event, the rockstars of your mental concert. No, it watches the goddamn usher’s assistant’s assistant. It watches the blood going *toward* the neurons after they’ve already popped off like firecrackers on Diwali in your head. It’s as precise as trying to determine who farted in a crowded metro by sniffing the air five minutes later while also blindfolded and wearing a nose plug.

And even *that* only works because hydrogen—the sluttiest of all atoms, with its single electron and its desperate need for validation—gets all tingly in a magnetic field and decides to flash its knickers as it relaxes. That’s your data. That’s what a billion-dollar brain scanner is measuring. The tingle of atomic desperation. And we’re supposed to pull *truth* from that?

Jesus. I can’t even pull my socks on straight without nearly dislocating a hip, and you want me to trust this goddamn mental horoscope machine?

Also, and this needs to be said—because I’ve *been* in those rooms, and I’ve *watched*—if your homework while lying in the scanner happens to be, say, solving a math problem, or remembering your mother’s face, or watching porn featuring aliens with improbably proportioned tentacles, then guess what? The machine doesn’t see the erection, the shame, the sudden urge to weep—no, it sees a vague red blob in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and goes “Oh look, activation!” Meanwhile the lady technician, sipping sugared tea behind the screen, doesn’t know your dick’s rising like the Titanic’s last gasp—unless she glances at the crotch of your track pants and catches the bulge.

Which she does.

They always do.

My own MRI scan was done in 2009. I remember this because I’d just broken up with whatever serotonin factory God had placed in my brain, and my psychiatrist—who looked like the bastard son of Karl Marx and a disappointed goat—wanted to “see if anything’s lighting up.” As if I was a Christmas tree waiting to be diagnosed. They made me lie down in that fucking tube with the noise of an industrial printer fucking a lawn mower echoing in my ears and asked me to imagine my “safe place.” I thought of dying in my sleep. They said nothing lit up. I told them that was accurate.

Anyway, that’s the state of neuroscience. Your brain is a mystery box, and we’re poking it with magnets and asking it to confess to crimes it doesn’t remember committing. And I’m expected to drag something coherent out of that? I should be awarded the Padma Bhushan for managing to keep my pants on.

It’s like expecting a pigeon to deliver Shakespeare when all you gave it was pigeon feed and unresolved trauma.

There are days—most days—when the sheer effort of forming a *point* feels like squeezing toothpaste from your urethra. And not metaphorically. I mean that exact sensation. The burn. The resistance. The way your eyes water involuntarily because you can feel the wrongness of the act in your very spine.

And you know what?

Even this—this feculent, reluctant brain dump—is a win. Because most days, nothing gets written. Most days I sit and scroll and scratch at my scalp and tug at the threadbare waistband of my boxer shorts while outside some cunt-shaped god in the sky pours piss-flavored sunlight onto my peeling window grill and I think, “Maybe today’s not worth it either.”

But I’m still here. Still typing.

Still warm.

Still vaguely tumescent for no reason except biology hasn’t shut the fuck up yet.

And honestly, that’s about as close as I get to meaning these days.
India, where the magnets wobble, the minds flicker, and the dicks occasionally twitch.
