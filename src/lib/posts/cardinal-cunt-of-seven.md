The first thing you notice about the number 7 is that it won’t stay in its lane, it doesn’t behave like a normal, respectable integer, it walks into your life like a cocksucker relative at a wedding—uninvited, loud, smelling faintly of stale paan and certainty—so there I am in South Calcutta, the great concrete hospice of ambition, sweating through my vest like a leaking water tank, stomach doing that slow, ominous churn that means either gas or disaster, and someone is on WhatsApp again with a forward, a fucking forward, with seven emojis and seven blessings and seven steps and seven planets and seven days and seven promises and seven sacred somethings, and I can *feel* my body getting angry before my mind even finishes reading, like my intestines are the first rationalists in the room.

Seven. The cardinal cunt of numerology. The number that people use the way they use deodorant in this city: not to fix the problem, just to perfume the rot.

You can’t escape it. Seven is in the calendar, seven is in the sky, seven is in your grandmother’s mouth when she tells you not to cut your nails on Thursday or whatever the hell it is, seven is in the priest’s invoice, seven is in the god-market’s marketing copy, seven is in the thin, oily smile of the guy selling “energy stones” outside the metro station like it’s a normal job and not a scam dressed up as spirituality, like a turd wearing a tie.

And the thing is, I’m not even angry at the number. Seven is innocent. Seven is just a shape. Seven is a little bent stick with a hat. Seven didn’t ask for this. Seven didn’t apply for the position of cosmic manager. People did this. People took a number—this quiet, abstract tool of counting fish and counting debts—and stuffed it into the panties of the divine like a cheap joke, and then acted surprised when it started smelling like human nonsense.

It’s always panties with these people, isn’t it, always a secret compartment, a hidden pocket, a sacred fold where the universe tucks its “meaning,” because meaning has to be hidden, it has to be teased out like some bashful bride, it can’t just be sitting on the table like facts, because facts are rude, facts don’t touch your feet and say “pranam,” facts don’t give you a free pass for being lazy, facts don’t let you pretend your life is a movie with a soundtrack and an interval.

Seven is the interval bell of superstition.

It’s also, if you’re living in this climate, a number you can smell. I’m not kidding. Winter in Calcutta is a liar; it pretends to be crisp and European for two weeks, then it turns into damp breath and diesel and the sweet rot of old leaves. Sound travels farther. Smells travel farther. Your neighbor’s TV travels into your bedroom like it pays rent. Somewhere down the lane a wedding DJ is trying to punch a hole through physics with bass. And through all of it—sound, stink, sweat—comes the ceremonial seven, like a fart that insists it is a hymn.

People love numerology because it’s the fastest way to feel in control without doing anything. It’s capitalism for the soul: outsource your thinking, buy a product called “certainty,” and if it fails, blame your “vibration.” It’s also colonialism’s favorite aftertaste. The British may have left, but the craving for official stamps stayed behind. We still want the universe to issue us a certificate: Approved. Blessed. Valid. Seven is the rubber stamp. Thump. Approved by the cosmos. Thump. Guaranteed returns on your suffering. Thump. Your misery has meaning, now please proceed to the next counter.

Meanwhile, my body is doing its own audit. Fifty-something body. The body of a man who has read too many books and eaten too much fried shit and slept too little and sat too long and hoped too often that “tomorrow” will behave like a serious concept. My knees complain like old union leaders. My skin is a humid argument. My gut is a committee meeting where nobody agrees. I stand up too fast and the room tilts, like the universe is reminding me: you are not a metaphysical hero, you are a bag of water with opinions.

And that’s what makes numerology so insulting. It’s not just wrong, it’s *lazy in the face of biology*. You want cosmic patterns? Look at your own damn body. Look at the way one bad meal can turn you into a sweating, praying animal in five minutes. Look at how your heart is basically a loyal pump with terrible work-life balance. Look at how your brain, that proud philosopher, can be hijacked by a headache and suddenly you’re not a rationalist, you’re a whimpering mammal negotiating with darkness.

But no, people don’t want the honest patterns. They want flattering patterns. They want patterns that make them feel chosen, not patterns that remind them they’re compost with a phone.

So they take seven and they dress it up. Seven chakras. Seven steps. Seven holy somethings. Seven seas, seven heavens, seven vows, seven this, seven that. We borrowed it from everywhere too, like we’re running a spiritual thrift store. You can find seven in Hinduism, sure, but also in Christianity, Islam, Judaism, ancient Greek ideas, old Babylonian sky-counting—humans everywhere have stared at the same stars and tried to make their fear into a system. Nobody owns seven. Everybody rents it. And the rent is paid in gullibility.

There’s a scientific reason seven shows up so much, and it’s boring, which is exactly why nobody forwards it on WhatsApp with sparkles. Humans like small numbers because our brains like manageable chunks. Memory has limits. Attention has limits. Culture has limits. Seven is a nice little handful. It’s not too big, not too small. It feels “special” because it’s just awkward enough—prime, indivisible, smug. Seven is the guy at the party who can’t be split into couples, so he stands alone near the snacks and people start assigning him mystical depth.

And then the whole thing becomes a feedback loop: people repeat that seven is special, so it feels special, so it gets repeated, so it becomes special, like a rumor that becomes a religion because nobody can be bothered to check.

That’s where my erotic shame lives too, not in any glamorous way—nothing glamorous is happening here, trust me—but in that same human mechanism of wanting a story instead of a fact. Desire is a stupid, stubborn animal. It wants narrative. It wants symbolism. It wants a “sign.” It wants to believe a glance meant something, a silence meant something, a dream meant something, a coincidence meant something. It wants to turn random noise into fate, because fate is sexier than entropy. Entropy is a buzzkill. Entropy doesn’t flirt. Entropy doesn’t promise. Entropy just sits there like a turd in the middle of the road and says, “Walk around me, genius.”

So you get this absurd situation: I’m a rationalist, an atheist, a book-rotted skeptic, and still my body carries this ancient, embarrassing urge to be *chosen*—by a person, by a moment, by a universe that notices me—while my mind is standing behind it like a weary security guard saying, “Sir, please stop grinding on metaphysics, this is a public place.”

And that’s the real comedy of seven. Seven is a number people use to dress up loneliness. Seven is a decorative curtain over a cracked wall. Seven is incense sprayed on a clogged drain. Seven is spirituality’s air freshener, and if you’ve ever used air freshener in a Calcutta bathroom you know what I mean: it doesn’t remove the stink, it just adds perfume to the crime scene.

Somewhere in old North Calcutta, in the lanes that still smell like coal and frying oil and old books, there’s a little shop with a calendar of gods and a little pile of plastic idols and a little radio blaring some moral lecture, and the shopkeeper will tell you, with total confidence, that seven is auspicious and three is dangerous and eight is powerful and nine is motherly and whatever else the market currently sells, and the confidence is the product. The number is just packaging. The real commodity is relief: the relief of not having to think.

Thinking is hard. Thinking doesn’t guarantee anything. Thinking doesn’t give you a coupon code for the future. Thinking just tells you the truth, and the truth, most days, is that life is not a story, it’s a messy pile of causes and accidents and compromises and bodily functions, and if you’re lucky you get a few clean minutes of joy between the shitting and the bills.

Even my body knows this. My body doesn’t care about seven. My body cares about water, salt, blood sugar, sleep, stress. My body cares about whether the fish was fresh. My body cares about whether the neighbor is playing bass again like he’s auditioning for a war crime. My body cares about whether the air is thick with diesel. My body cares about whether I walked enough or sat like a dead sack for twelve hours staring at screens. My body is a brutal materialist. My body is the Marxist I pretend to be.

And yet—this is the humiliating part—some days the superstition still tries to sneak in through the back door. Not as belief, but as temptation. You see seven and a tiny part of you wants it to mean something, because meaning is easier than responsibility. Meaning is easier than admitting you made bad choices, or you live in a bad system, or you’re aging, or you’re lonely, or you’re just a fragile animal with delusions of grandeur.

Seven is the delusion with good branding.

So I sit here in my South Calcutta exile, listening to the city wheeze, feeling my own sweat cool into stickiness, watching another forward crawl across my screen like a cockroach with a halo, and I think: imagine if we treated numbers the way we treat food. Imagine if we asked, “Is this fresh? Is this clean? Is this real?” before swallowing it. Imagine if we stopped eating spiritual street food from strangers. Imagine if we stopped licking the universe’s underwear and calling it wisdom.

But people won’t stop. Because seven sells. Seven consoles. Seven makes the chaos feel like a plan. Seven makes the suffering feel like a test instead of a random slap. Seven makes the world feel like it has a manager, and that manager has a spreadsheet, and your name is on it, and someday you’ll get your due.

And I, the proud rationalist, the atheist, the book-heavy bastard, still have to admit something quietly disgusting: on bad nights, when the city is loud and my mind is louder and my body feels like a failing appliance, even I understand the seduction. Not the belief—fuck that—but the seduction. The soft little lie that says: you’re not just drifting, you’re *destined*. You’re not just sweating, you’re *purifying*. You’re not just lonely, you’re *waiting for a sign*.

Then I burp. Or my stomach growls. Or some stray pain lights up like a rude notification. And the universe, in its infinite wisdom, sends me the only sacred message it reliably delivers:

Go to the bathroom, you idiot.
