The inverter does its little dying-goldfish beep and the tube light above my sink decides—after a ceremonial hesitation—to become a light. Not brightness, not cheer, just illumination, like a government form filled in correctly: yes, there will be photons, but don’t get sentimental about it.

I’m standing there with my thumb pressed into the soft bruise of yesterday’s life—shin against the edge of a bed, knee against the corner of a table, ego against reality, take your pick—and the hurt blooms on schedule, punctual as a Bengali relative who has come to ask what I’m doing with my life. The body has this vulgar honesty. It doesn’t argue. It doesn’t negotiate. It doesn’t “contextualize.” It simply sends up a flare: *something is wrong here, boss.*

And this is where I have to admit the irritating part.

**Hurt is good.** Not good like “never hurting” is—no one sane would choose pain as a hobby—but good in the way smoke is good when the kitchen is on fire. Hurt is the last union worker still doing his job. Nociceptors—those little complaint departments in skin and muscle—exist because creatures that didn’t feel pain tended to do things like continue jogging while their foot fell off, which is, in Darwin’s ledger, a charming personality trait but a short career.

So yes: hurt is a gift, in the same way a tax notice is a gift. It proves you are still in the system. It proves you are still *addressable*.

The trouble is what I do with it.

I don’t just feel hurt. I renovate it. I build an extension. I add a balcony and stand there every evening, sipping tea, looking down at the same street inside my skull, watching the same procession go by—circumstances, grievances, failures, humiliations—like I’m the world’s most loyal spectator of a terrible local play that closed years ago but keeps getting restaged because I can’t stop buying tickets.

Rumination is such a polite word, isn’t it. It sounds pastoral. A cow chewing thoughtfully under a tree. In the brain it’s more like a stray dog worrying a bone that has no marrow left, just the idea of marrow. Over and over and over again. Neural loops with the aesthetic of a scratched CD: here comes the chorus, here comes the chorus, here comes the chorus.

Somewhere around fifty—today, December 29, 2025, a date that feels both arbitrary and accusatory—I notice the loops more clearly, which is not the same as escaping them. Fifty is good enough, yes, in the blunt accounting sense: still alive, still upright, still capable of being irritated by philosophy. But it also feels like standing at the base of a hill that has discovered the concept of exponentials. Everything ahead looks steeper, not because the path changed but because the legs did, and because the world has started speaking in the manic register of acceleration.

In the old North Calcutta of my childhood, the future arrived like a new ceiling fan or a new television—one household at a time, wheezing into the neighborhood with a sense of earned modernity. Now the future threatens to arrive like a stampede: not as a gadget, but as a rearrangement of the social contract, the labor market, the mind itself. The word everyone loves to fling around is “singularity,” which sounds like a shimmering mathematical event horizon, as if we’ll all glide into it like swans.

I have a less lyrical suspicion: the singularity, for people like me in the unfashionable fringes of South Calcutta, will feel less like transcendence and more like logistics.

Water pressure that turns the morning into a negotiation. Power that arrives in stuttering syllables—loadshedding as punctuation. A city sweating under its own damp armpits while somewhere else, in a cooled bunker of servers, a polite artificial mind composes sonnets about the dignity of mankind.

People imagine augmentation as a sleek comic-book upgrade: organic AI, robotic exoskeletons, brain-computer symphonies. Fine. Let them have their titanium fantasies. In my version, the winners get exoskeletons and the rest of us get—how to put it—*sociological osteoporosis*. Jobs go first, then meaning. Minds go next. The streets fill with anachronisms: men trained for a world that has been uninstalled, wandering around like outdated software still running on human hardware.

That’s the dread of 2026 tapping at the door: not apocalypse, not drama, just a tightening spiral of “sorry, not available”—services, dignity, attention, sanity.

And the absurd part is that the science is both magnificent and brutally unromantic.

An AI system isn’t a demigod. It’s a machine that eats electricity, turns it into computation, and excretes heat. That’s not metaphor; that’s thermodynamics—the universe’s least negotiable religion. Every grand talk of intelligence has a grubby underside: copper, silicon, cooling, water, supply chains, rare earths, geopolitics, and a rising pile of waste heat like the invisible trash behind a restaurant kitchen. The “techno-sociological singularity” may end up being, for most humans, a kind of planetary digestion problem: the new machine-metabolism demands clean power and clean water, and the old human-metabolism—us, with our small needs and large frailties—gets told to eat less, dream less, and ideally complain less.

This is where my own language becomes untrustworthy, because when I’m frightened I become theatrical, and when I become theatrical I start giving my fear costumes. I imagine myself as refuse, as something flushable, as a bit of biology the system would rather not see. It’s not dignified. It’s not even accurate. It’s just the brain reaching for a picture big enough to hold the feeling.

*Dukkho*, we say. Or *kosto*. The words have heft; they sit in the mouth differently than “hurt,” which in English feels like a clean bruise, a neat little syllable. In Sanskrit and Pali there is *duḥkha*, and here comes the irresistible bit of folk etymology—the kind of thing Instagram spirituality loves to purr—that *duḥkha* means “bad axle-hole,” as if suffering is literally a wheel that doesn’t fit right. It’s a lovely image. It’s also, as far as serious linguists can tell, mostly a story people tell because it’s too delicious to resist. A debunked etymology is still an etymology of the heart. Humans prefer a clever picture to a boring truth, and I, rationalist that I claim to be, am not immune.

Maybe that’s part of why hurt is “good.” It’s the one thing that refuses to be prettified for long. You can decorate it with philosophy, drown it in ideology, blame it on karma, fate, the nation, the West, your parents, your ex, your own weak character, Mercury in retrograde, whatever spiritual brand is trending. But the raw signal remains: something in you is rubbing wrong against reality.

The modern mind’s tragedy is that it has learned to treat pain as content.

I don’t just hurt; I narrate the hurt. I produce it. I replay it. I turn it into a private documentary series—Season 12 now, still no satisfying finale—because the brain is a prediction machine and the past is its favorite training dataset. Every time I retell the story, I am not merely remembering; I am *rewriting* the memory, reconsolidating it, polishing its edges, strengthening the pathways that lead back to it like well-trodden alleyways in Burrabazar. The hippocampus, the amygdala, the default mode network—names that sound like a British indie band lineup—keep doing their work while I sit here thinking I’m “reflecting.”

Reflection is what a mirror does. Rumination is what a closed room does.

So yes: hurt is good, and I keep it alive in the worst possible way, like a pet I feed too well.

A kinder way to phrase it—still not hopeful, just accurate—is that pain is a measurement. It tells me where I am still attached to the world. Not attached in a poetic way. Attached like a wire that still conducts current.

Outside, someone’s generator starts up with that rancid, oily confidence. A street dog barks at nothing in particular, which is, frankly, the most rational response to the age we’re entering. My tube light flickers once, as if reconsidering its earlier promise of illumination.

I take my thumb off the bruise. The pain fades a little, not because the problem is solved, but because the body has done its duty and moved on, like a clerk stamping a file.

The mind, of course, is eager to reopen the case.

I stir my tea until the last sugar granules stop scraping the steel, watch the surface settle, and think: the future may be a cliff, yes—but for tonight, my small act of def iance is to keep my hands steady enough not to spill.
