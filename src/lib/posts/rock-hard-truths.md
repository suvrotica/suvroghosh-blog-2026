Sometimes you just want to watch the Earth crack open like an egg with trust issues.

Or see some Icelandic bastard poke a lava flow with a stick  
while cheerfully narrating the impending doom of Reykjavik  
in a voice that sounds like warm bread and stoic fatalism.

So yeah—starting now,  
I’ll be dumping some strange, stirring, sometimes staggering geology videos here.  
Mostly from YouTube.  
Sometimes featuring men with beards and suspiciously sexy sediment samples.  
Sometimes grainy 1970s BBC clips that smell like chalk and colonial anxiety.  
Sometimes drone porn of volcanoes so hot they make your inner tectonic plate shift.

No schedule. No theme.  
Just rock formations, magma erections,  
erosion that feels like a slow breakup,  
and the kind of plate tectonics  
that make your own fractured life  
feel somehow continental.

Because when the planet farts basalt  
or folds like an overworked Bengali uncle's lungi in May—  
it helps to watch.
