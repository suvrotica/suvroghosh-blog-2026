This morning my pillow looked like it had hosted a small, private blizzard—white flecks, grey grit, the occasional black comma of something that might be dandruff or might be the soot from yesterday’s city, which has learned to crawl indoors the way certain relatives do: without invitation, with entitlement, and with a long memory for corners you forgot existed.

I sat up and the light did that Calcutta thing where it pretends to be sunlight but is really an argument—hazy, particulate, morally undecided—and when I scratched my scalp (not dramatically, not in some operatic “woe is me” fashion, just the ordinary scratch of a man trying to locate his own body in the morning) a few more flakes let go and floated down with the slow dignity of ash after a riot.

In my old North Calcutta room, dust had a job description. It arrived from the street, it settled on books, it made the almirah look older than it was, and once a week someone would wipe it with a cloth that quickly became the same color as the dust, which felt like a philosophical joke: you cannot defeat the enemy without becoming him. Now in South Calcutta’s unfashionable fringes—where the buses come grudgingly, where the new buildings stand like freshly minted lies—the dust is less quaint. It has gone corporate. It comes with metrics.

AQI: three letters that make air sound like a quarterly report.

I checked the phone the way modern people check omens. The app showed a number—high enough to qualify as a personality trait—and a color that looked like it belonged on a caution tape, or perhaps on the face of a government spokesperson explaining that everything is under control, which is the universal phrase meaning: nothing is under control, but please don’t ask for receipts.

The problem with numbers is that they soothe even when they indict. “Very Unhealthy,” the app said, and my mind—trained by exams, rank lists, and the gospel of marks—did the old obedient thing: Ah yes, a category. Now I know where I stand. As if breathing were another board exam. As if your lungs could be graded and then scolded for not writing answers in the proper format.

Dust, dandruff, AQI—three forms of the same small humiliation. Dust is the world arriving uninvited on your shelves. Dandruff is your body producing its own dust, a private weather system of dissatisfaction. AQI is the state and the market agreeing, for once, on a shared fiction: that if you measure the poison precisely enough, it becomes information rather than poison.

The science is straightforward in a way our politics never is. Particles. Tiny bits of stuff suspended in air, floating around like gossip in a *para*, except gossip at least has the decency to be audible. PM10, PM2.5—names that sound like exam papers from a sadistic institution: “You have three hours. Inhale quietly. No calculators.” The smaller ones are nastier, not because they are morally corrupt (molecules don’t do sin) but because they slip deeper into you. Your nose hairs—the ancient, underfunded border security of the body—can catch the larger intruders. The smaller ones stroll in wearing a blazer and carrying a laminated ID card.

And what are these particles made of? The romance dies quickly: vehicle exhaust, road dust, construction debris, industrial emissions, biomass burning, the occasional festive bonfire of collective stupidity. There is no single villain with a moustache you can twirl. The air is a committee decision.

*Dhulo*, my grandmother used to say—dust, as if naming it made it domestic. There’s a Bengali intimacy to certain nuisances. We don’t just have dust; we have *dhulo-moyla* (dust-and-filth), a compound word that admits reality is rarely solitary. The room is never merely dusty. It is dust plus something else: neglect, time, the residue of living.

Dandruff too has its folk mythology. Someone will tell you it’s because you ate too much *tel* (oil), someone else will prescribe a neem paste, someone will whisper about “heat in the body” as if you are a defective pressure cooker. The body, in our household cosmology, is always a kitchen appliance. But dandruff is usually simpler: your scalp sheds skin cells, sometimes more than usual, sometimes because of a yeast that lives on us like a quiet tenant. The horror is not that a fungus exists—fungi are everywhere, and frankly they have better architectural instincts than we do. The horror is that your body is an ecosystem and you are not the landlord. You are the entire apartment building, arguing with itself.

I know this, and still I scratch. Knowledge does not abolish itch. Knowledge simply adds narration. Ah, you say to yourself, this is seborrheic dermatitis, the inflammation of the scalp associated with *Malassezia*— and your fingers keep doing the ancient animal thing because your nervous system did not attend your education.

Education, in fact, is part of the trouble. We were trained to treat air as nothing. It is the blank page on which life writes itself. You don’t think about it until it becomes legible as harm. In school, “pollution” was a chapter—some diagrams, some moralizing, a poster competition where the most talented child drew a sad fish floating belly-up in a river, and we all clapped, and then we went home and burned plastic because the garbage van didn’t come.

If air had been taught properly, it would have been taught like a crime scene. Not dramatic—just meticulous. You would begin with the fact that air is not one thing. It is a mixture, like society. Mostly nitrogen, some oxygen, argon, carbon dioxide, water vapor—then the trace villains, the chemicals that matter precisely because they’re small, because they operate in the shadows. The lesson would not end with “keep the environment clean,” that sanctimonious sentence which is the civic equivalent of telling a poor man to “be confident.” The lesson would end with the actual machinery: combustion chemistry, how burning fuel produces nitrogen oxides, sulfur compounds, particulates; how sunlight drives reactions to form ozone at ground level; how temperature inversions trap pollutants close to the earth like a lid on a pot that nobody is watching.

But our syllabi love the shape of knowledge more than its function. We produce students who can define “AQI” without noticing the sky looks like a long exhale from a dying engine.

Also, the air has become a stage for spiritual branding, which is our national hobby: take a real problem, sprinkle it with a mantra, sell it back as salvation. I have seen “healing pranayama” classes advertised as if lungs are a mood you can adjust with the right playlist. Breathing exercises can be useful, yes—your nervous system responds to slow exhalations, your stress can soften—but a calm inhale of poison is still poison. You cannot *om* your way around particulate matter. The universe is not that sentimental.

Colonial history drifts in here, uninvited, like the dust. The British did not “give” us railways and sanitation out of philanthropic ardor; they built infrastructure to extract, to move goods, to administer. Cities like Calcutta were shaped as interfaces—ports, warehouses, bureaucracy. The air of empire was smoke: coal, ship engines, jute mills. The romance of “heritage” often forgets that heritage is frequently a byproduct of industrial coughing. We inherit architecture, yes, but we also inherit the habit of treating the city as a machine that must run regardless of what it does to bodies.

Postcolonial life did not abolish that habit. We simply localized the arrogance. Now we do development with devotional fervor, as if flyovers are temples and GDP is the deity. You can question anything here except the religion of growth. *Bikash*—development—becomes a word you must chant, and if you ask, gently, whether the growth is poisoning the air, you are told you are anti-national, anti-progress, anti-aspiration, possibly anti-everything except your own depressing books.

This is where I contradict myself, because I like comfort too. I enjoy the conveniences of modern life in the way a man enjoys the fan in May—without wanting to think about the power plant. I complain about cars while using rideshare when I’m tired. I mock consumerism while ordering another book that will sit, accusingly, under a layer of dust. My principles, like my scalp, shed.

The AQI number on my phone has a strange psychological effect: it transforms the air into a moral scoreboard. On bad days, I feel I am breathing wrong, as if my lungs are failing a test. On good days—when the number drops because the wind changed or the rain came—I feel a small, childish relief, as if the world has pardoned me. This is nonsense, but it is a very modern nonsense. We have replaced gods with dashboards. Same hunger for certainty, improved typography.

There’s also the small comedy of domestication. Dust is the most democratic substance on earth. It settles on Marx and on the Bhagavad Gita with equal indifference. It sits on your framed certificates, quietly suggesting they will someday be indistinguishable from old newspapers. Dust is time made visible, which is why it irritates us. We can tolerate aging as an abstract; we cannot tolerate it on the surface of our table.

Dandruff is the same message, delivered by your own body in a more personal font. Your skin is constantly renewing, sloughing off the old. It is a reminder that you are not a stable object. You are a process. This should be liberating, philosophically, but in practice it means your shirt collar looks like it belongs to a man who has been using chalk to solve imaginary equations all night, which is not the glamorous image of “intellectual labor” we were promised.

I once heard someone claim that “dandruff” comes from “dandy” plus “rough,” as if it were a fashionable man’s problem. It’s charmingly wrong. Folk etymology loves this kind of pun because it makes language feel like a clever friend. Real etymology is less cute and more like dust itself: a slow accumulation of history. “Dandruff” likely comes from an older word for scurf—flakes of skin—mixed with sound changes and the ordinary mess of speech. Words evolve the way cities do: without a master plan, through small acts of use, neglect, and improvisation.

AQI, by contrast, is a designed word. It is a technocratic label with no poetry, which is why it fits our age so well. It is the sort of acronym that can be printed on a billboard without blushing. It gives the illusion that the chaos of air can be summarized the way you summarize a child’s report card.

And yet—annoyingly—metrics do matter. The very thing I distrust, the number, is also a flashlight. Without measurement, we are left with vibes. And vibes are how power likes you: squinting, uncertain, arguing about whether the sky is “really that bad” while the particulate matter continues its quiet invasion.

So the rationalist in me keeps the app. The misanthrope in me resents needing it. The depressive in me notes that none of this will be fixed quickly because it would require collective discipline, and we are not good at that unless someone can monetize it or mythologize it. The hypomanic part of me briefly imagines a city where every child learns air chemistry the way they learn multiplication, where buses are clean, where construction is regulated, where waste is managed, where the sky is not an ongoing apology—then that part gets tired and sits down.

I brush my shoulders. More flakes. Tiny, ridiculous, intimate evidence that I am both the victim and the generator of dust.

Outside, someone is drilling into concrete, that sacred sound of “progress,” the whine of a machine biting stone, producing the very particles that will later appear on my books like an unsolicited footnote. A scooter passes, leaving behind a faint stink of fuel, and for a moment the air smells like a garage and a kitchen and a funeral pyre, all layered together—the city’s true perfume, not the imported nonsense sold in glass bottles.

I open the window anyway, because the room is stale, because the fan is moving the same tired molecules in circles, because I am human and I keep choosing imperfect options and pretending they are decisions.

# Biology of Avoidance

A thin beam of light falls across my desk. In it, the dust floats—slow, glittering, almost beautiful, like a galaxy of small mistakes suspended in air.

Congratulations, I think, you are breathing the universe’s filing system.
