There’s this stinging patch on the inside of my left thigh that won’t go away—it’s not fungal, not heat rash, not even proper eczema—it’s just a phantom itch of nostalgia, I think, like my flesh itself is mourning the fact that no one’s touched me with anything resembling hunger or admiration since the UPA-2 government collapsed, and my libido now lives somewhere between my upper colon and last month's failed attempt at jerking off to a fucking toothpaste ad because the model reminded me, faintly, of someone who once said she liked my handwriting.

The mornings here begin with the wheeze of a dying pressure cooker and the sound of a crippled pigeon dry-heaving on my window ledge—its feathers all fucked, like it fell asleep in someone’s frying pan and barely made it out. And somehow, over the little gas flame next to the stained sink, I’m playing goddamn YouTube songs from 2004, songs I associate with afternoons in the university library, where I pretended to read Wittgenstein but really spent entire hours looping “Tujh Mein Rab Dikhta Hai” and thinking I understood love. I didn’t. I don’t. I still jerk off to the idea that I might have, once.

And that’s the fucking problem. These songs—they’re little syringes filled with yesterday's semen and formalin and they stab me right in the bloated gut of my past. My moments of tenderness? They’re corpses, wrapped in cling film, microwaved every evening with rice and ghee. I watch them swirl in my memory like dead goldfish flushed down the toilet, except it’s my own cock I’m flushing, limp, pathetic, and smelling faintly of Parachute coconut oil and disappointment.

YouTube, the fucking eternal museum of soft-focus regret, offers me playlists like “90s Love Songs – Pure Bliss ❤️” while I sit cross-legged in a lungi that smells of unwashed bedsheet and yesteryear farts. The algorithm, like an overfamiliar auntie at a wedding, keeps offering me glimpses of women I don’t talk to anymore, faces that once turned to me in beds and bars and borrowed taxis, eyes that once saw me as someone who might be worth it. Now those same faces are ads for mutual funds, menstrual cups, and weekend getaways with husbands who wear loafers without socks.

And the worst fucking part? I still click. I still listen. Like a stupid hungry lab rat punching the dopamine button with his shriveled dick. Every chorus—every cheesy fucking sitar-inflected chord progression—is a Proustian cunt-punch. I remember her laugh, her fingers on my chin, her vaguely medicinal smell. I remember holding her bra like a sacred relic, not knowing what the fuck to do with it because the only sex I’d had till then was with my own left hand and a confused dream about Zeenat Aman.

Love wasn’t a thing I fell into. It was a tripwire I mistook for a safety rope. And now, all the songs remind me of a version of myself I never quite became—a man who believed in things, who made mix tapes, who thought the smell of someone’s shampoo could anchor a future. Now I smell like burnt milk, piss-stained boxers, and hair oil that expired in 2021.

I once made a playlist called “For Her” and sent it to a girl who ghosted me so hard she probably became a fucking Bhoot in a Ram Gopal Varma movie. And yet, I keep listening to that same list, as if each track might contain a footnote to a life I should have lived, but didn’t. The kind of life where I kiss someone in the rain instead of worrying if my right knee will lock up while squatting over the Indian-style toilet.

And all of this—this wet, greasy, cling-wrapped ball of memory—it lives in my belly like undigested papaya. Some nights it gurgles. Some nights it tries to climb up into my throat, like bile, like grief, like a love letter written in permanent marker on a used condom.

What the fuck is the point of remembering? Memory is a piece of chewing gum I stuck behind my own ear and now can’t remove. It stinks. It sticks. It hardens into strange shapes. My mother asks me if I’ve eaten. I lie. I say yes. I haven't. My stomach is filled with ghosts, songs, and the acidic leftovers of last night’s over-salted khichdi.

There's science here, too, somewhere. Something about auditory cortex, limbic system, hippocampus—how music cues trigger neural pathways associated with emotional tagging, how we assign meaning to melodies and associate them with hormonal surges from our pathetic adolescence when we still believed in kissing and job security. But now? Now the only thing music triggers is a bowel movement and an erection I can’t maintain. A song from 2001, a half-chub, and a tear. That’s it. That’s the cocktail.

I am a man built from expired parts. My past is a haunted bazaar. My present is a broken tea kettle with a lizard inside it. And the future? Fuck the future. It smells like overcooked broccoli and sounds like a government call center playing “Mere Haath Mein” on loop while you wait to renew your Aadhar.

And every time I hear a song I once loved—every fucking time—I sit there, blinking at the screen, one hand scratching my flaky scalp, the other cupping my now utterly useless genitals, wondering if that moment in 1999 under the banyan tree, holding her hand for the first time, was real or if I just made it up to survive the slow death of my own libido.

Even hope has halitosis now.

And I can’t find the fucking remote.
