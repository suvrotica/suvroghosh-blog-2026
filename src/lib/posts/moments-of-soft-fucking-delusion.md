The day starts with my tea pan screaming like it’s being exorcised, metal on flame, water threatening to mutiny, while my head does that familiar pre-dawn thing where it inventories every mistake I’ve ever made and a few I haven’t gotten around to yet, and I’m standing there scratching the inside of my elbow like a nervous chimp, thinking not about sex or love or any of the usual pornographic lies we sell ourselves, but about whether the song I’m about to play will shut this fucking noise off for five minutes or just rearrange it into a more melodic form of suffering.

The songs some of them generations before I happened, I return to—because I always return, like a loyal dog or a moron—aren’t really about romance, not in the way people think when they hear me muttering along to some soft Hindi nonsense from the late nineties. They’re not postcards from failed affairs or ghosted women or beds that went cold. They’re older than that. Pre-sexual. Pre-disaster. They belong to a time when my brain hadn’t yet declared war on itself, when bipolarity was still a rumor, a distant thunderclap, not the full fucking monsoon dumping depression straight into my skull with no drainage plan.

These songs are about childhood, or at least about a slice of life when I wasn’t constantly negotiating with my own chemistry like a hostage-taker with mood swings. Back when the worst thing I worried about was homework and whether my socks matched, not whether today would be a “can’t get out of bed” day or a “pace the room like a deranged cocksucker” day. When I listen now, it’s not nostalgia for a person; it’s nostalgia for neurological quiet. For the absence of static.

Sometimes it works. That’s the maddening part. Sometimes a familiar intro—three notes, a breath of tanpura, a voice slightly off-key in a way that feels human—lands just right and my mind takes a break. Not a cure. Not enlightenment. Just a pause. Like someone hit mute on the inner narrator who keeps yelling that I’m a useless turd wasting oxygen. For a few minutes I can sit there, tea cooling, balls sticking to my thigh, and feel almost ordinary. Almost unbroken. Almost like a man instead of a walking DSM footnote.

Other times it does fuck-all. Worse than fuck-all. The music plays and my brain folds inward like a cheap lawn chair, and all I want to do is curl into the familiar discomfort, knees pulled up, eyes shut, marinating in that dense, syrupy sadness that feels perversely safe because at least it’s predictable. Depression, for all its cruelty, is consistent. It shows up on time. It doesn’t improvise. It’s the most reliable relationship I’ve ever had.

But when I reach for music—when I decide, against evidence, that sound might help—I don’t experiment. I don’t go hunting for new artists or fresh experiences like some wellness influencer with a beard and a podcast. I knock on the same doors. Again. And again. And again. The same playlists. The same songs. The same emotional furniture arranged just so. Because novelty requires energy, and energy is a luxury item I haven’t been able to afford since my brain decided to become a hostile foreign power.

There’s something almost pathological about it. Like a rat pressing the same lever even after the cheese is gone, hoping muscle memory might summon a miracle. I know exactly which songs might work, which ones sometimes work, which ones absolutely won’t but I play them anyway out of spite or boredom or masochism. These tracks aren’t memories; they’re tools. Blunt ones. Worn down. Handles slick with years of use. I grip them anyway because what else is there—mindfulness? Prayer? A brisk walk while chanting affirmations like “I am not a useless sack of shit”? Please.

People like to talk about music as transcendence. As healing. As art lifting us above the mess. That’s horseshit. For me, music is more like a dirty rag you press against a bleeding wound—not to cure it, just to keep the blood off the floor for a while. It’s chemical. Pavlovian. Sound waves nudging neurotransmitters like a bored technician poking malfunctioning equipment with a stick. Sometimes the machine hums. Sometimes it sparks and dies.

The science types will tell you about the hippocampus, about memory encoding, about how music bypasses certain cognitive checkpoints and plugs straight into emotional circuits like an illegal cable connection. Fine. Whatever. All I know is that these songs smell like old classrooms and bus rides and afternoons when time didn’t feel like a loaded gun pressed to my temple. They smell like dust and pencil shavings and the specific quiet of being young enough not to know what’s coming.

And I keep them close because the present is a crumbling façade held together with habit and low expectations. I still don’t know who the fuck I am. I’m not becoming anything. I’m not evolving. I’m maintaining. Barely. The music doesn’t remind me of who I was with—it reminds me of who I was before my own mind turned into a bureaucratic nightmare, requiring forms and approvals and apologies just to feel okay for an hour.

There’s no growth here. No arc. Just repetition. Same doors. Same knocks. Same hope that one of them will open onto that brief, ridiculous silence where the internal shouting stops and I can sit with my tea and my tired body and not actively hate the fact that I exist.

And when it doesn’t work, when the song fades and the noise rushes back in like a tide full of broken glass, I just sit there anyway, staring at the wall, humming the tune under my breath, because even failure is better when it’s familiar, and at this age, familiarity is the closest thing I have to comfort, even if it smells faintly of old socks, regret, and reheated rice.
