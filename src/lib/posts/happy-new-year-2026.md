Tonight the neighborhood is doing its annual experiment in applied chemistry: gunpowder, cheap paper, and the confidence of men who believe the universe can be impressed by noise. The air has that January-eve taste even before January exists—burnt cracker smoke, damp winter breath, and the faint metallic tang of Kolkata dust pretending to be atmospheric mystery. Somewhere a DJ is throttling a song into paste. Somewhere a dog is rethinking its relationship with humans. On my table: a calendar with a glossy picture of a waterfall I will never visit, a mug with tea gone cold in the way tea does when you stop believing in time, and a pen that works only when it feels respected.

People like to begin the year with blessings, resolutions, affirmations—the whole ceremonial laundering of the self. "Prosperous new year," they say, as if prosperity is a coupon code you can apply at checkout. I understand the urge. Humans have always loved the idea that the universe resets. The Hindus have yugas, the Christians have confession, the Marxists had history with a plot, Silicon Valley has "fresh starts" every time a product fails, and my building has a feral watchdog who doesn't know there's a tomorrow. We are a species addicted to the word "tomorrow" the way alcoholics are addicted to "just one more."

But the calendar is not a reset button. It is a numbering system stapled onto a thermodynamic slaughterhouse.


The arrow of time doesn't care about Gregorian enthusiasm. Entropy doesn't pause because your aunt forwarded a WhatsApp message with sparkles and "2026" in gold. The second law of thermodynamics is the only god that has never once asked for ghee and still gets what it wants. Things spread out. Heat leaks. Bodies creak. Regret accumulates. The past hardens into a shape you cannot re-melt without spending absurd energy, and most of us are already running on low battery, like those solar streetlights that glow heroically for three hours and then die quietly at 2 a.m., which is basically the human condition with a nicer marketing brochure.

So when I tell you "happy new year," I have to do it without lying, which is difficult because every socially approved greeting is, in some small way, a sanctioned lie. "Happy birthday" means "congratulations on remaining not-dead." "Good morning" means "I acknowledge you as an organism." "Happy new year" means "please pretend, with me, that time is negotiable."

Still. One can try to say the thing honestly.

### The Moving Walkway

Here is my honest model, since I am constitutionally incapable of offering sentiments without turning them into a diagram.

Imagine standing on one of those moving walkways at the airport. You can stand still and still go forward, sure, but only because the belt is doing the work. Now imagine that the belt is not level. It's angled upward. Now imagine the belt is speeding up, and the handrail is sticky, and the signage is in an unfamiliar language, and the people ahead of you are live-streaming their ascent while selling courses on "How I walked uphill effortlessly." Now imagine you are on the shadow side of the curve—the side where your feet keep slipping, where your calves burn, where you can see the incline but not the top, and where someone behind you keeps nudging you with the gentle violence of "just be positive."

That is the year-to-year feeling lately, and not only for me. Socio-economic acceleration is not a metaphor; it's the lived experience of compound interest applied to everything that can hurt you. Prices, expectations, comparison, noise, paperwork, the speed at which the world decides you are obsolete. If there is a singularity coming—technological, cultural, bureaucratic, pick your poison—it doesn't need flying cars to be terrifying. A singularity can be as banal as a society in which the average person cannot hold a thought long enough to notice they are being robbed, and the people doing the robbing have excellent fonts.

Judging 2025, I am uncomfortably where I was at the fag end of 2024, which is to say: the same room, the same habits, the same private negotiations with my own biology. I don't know about you. Maybe you conquered mountains. Maybe you built empires. Maybe you became one of those aggressively cheerful people who wake up at 5 a.m. to "own the day," which is a phrase that always makes me picture a man trying to register the Sun at the Registrar of Assurances in Alipore.

My situation is not grand. It's not even tragic in the cinematic way. It's just rot—a slow, ordinary decay of circumstance, health, mood, motivation, that doesn't look like anything on Instagram. Physical infirmities, mental weather, the tedious maintenance required to remain a functioning mammal. Some people have a dramatic fall. I have a gentle, administrative slide. The kind where the calendar changes but your inner room stays the same temperature, the same stale air, the same thoughts circling like those ceiling fans that wobble and refuse to die.

### A Wish Without Syrup

And yet: I cannot quite stop the impulse to wish something better for you.

Not because I believe the universe will reward you. The universe doesn't reward. It just continues. But because wishing is one of the few free actions left that doesn't require a subscription or a government form. A wish is cheap. A wish is defiant. A wish is a small rebellion against the cosmic conveyor belt.

So let me do it without the syrup.

In 2026, I hope you get more reality than propaganda. More sleep than scrolling. More quiet than performative noise. More skill than opinion. More useful discomfort than useless suffering. Fewer miracles, more mechanisms. Less "vibes," more evidence. Fewer people selling you enlightenment in EMI installments. More of that stubborn, unglamorous courage that consists of doing the next right thing when your mind is screaming that nothing matters.

And for me—since I am also in the queue, ticket in hand, on the same absurd moving belt—I will try, again, to do the thing I always claim to do: think clearly, write honestly, and keep one eye on the science even when my feelings are staging a coup. The new year is arbitrary, yes. But the body isn't. The mind isn't. The consequences aren't.

Outside, someone has started the countdown early, because time is fake but impatience is real. A rocket cracks open the sky like a cheap metaphor. The smoke drifts into my window and settles on my books, which will still be here tomorrow, quietly accumulating dust the way history does.

Happy new year, 2026.

The calendar will flip. The conveyor belt won't.
