At 11:58 p.m. I was watching the time on my smartphone—its clean, backlit digits pretending to be objective, like a bureaucrat in a freshly ironed shirt—when the whole house joined in anyway: the cold pressing in through the window seams, the distant cough of a scooter that refuses to die, the dry scrape of someone dragging a plastic chair across concrete, and, from somewhere in the neighborhood, the first premature cracker—because Bengalis cannot wait for anything, not trains, not revolutions, not enlightenment, not even midnight.

Years on antipsychotic meds for bipolar have also done this quiet, untheatrical thing to my insides: they’ve sanded down the peaks and filled in the valleys until nights like this arrive and… nothing arrives with them. No lift, no warmth, no anticipatory shimmer—just the observation that other people seem to be extracting joy from these battered themes, the same annual script with different dates, while my bookish bipolar brain watches it the way you watch a street magician when you already know the mechanism: mildly curious, mostly tired, and aware that the real problems are still sitting in the corner like unpaid bills. The firecracker extravaganza, meanwhile, isn’t “celebration” so much as a public health experiment conducted by amateurs; it’s perfectly plausible that I—and many others—will start the new year with a wheezing cough, or worse, because nothing says auspicious beginnings quite like deliberately turning your own neighborhood into a short-term respiratory ward.

I looked down at my feet, as if I could see it.

The belt.

Not an actual belt, of course—no helpful little conveyor with “TIME” printed in cheery corporate font—but that sensation you get in certain old factories, or at baggage claim in Dum Dum, when the rubber starts moving and you realize you have two choices: keep your hand on your suitcase or watch it slide away into somebody else’s life. The new year does this trick annually: it gives time a sound effect and a costume. It takes the same continuous flow—seconds pouring into seconds like indifferent tea into an already over-sugared cup—and snaps a chalk line across it so we can pretend we’ve arrived somewhere.

And yes, I want to wish you a prosperous new year.

Not the limp “Happy New Year :)” that people fling around like confetti made of emojis, but a wish with some spine in it, like a man setting down a bag of rice and saying, eat, don’t philosophize. Prosperity, for the record, is a word that has been domesticated into meaning “more money,” which is like saying the Himalayas are “a nice pile of rocks.” The older sense—Latin *prosperus*, favorable, doing well—was closer to “the wind is behind you,” which is still money-adjacent but at least acknowledges there is a wind, and that some of us are trying to row with a spoon.

# The Cost of Advice

I’m not pretending I’ve got saintly authority to dispense this wish. My greatest qualification is a sharp tongue and an allergy to comforting lies, which—historically—has paid very poorly. Even in the golden age of patronage, they didn’t put “excellent at pointing out obvious stupidity” on marble plaques. The few people who did were usually poisoned, exiled, or given an honorary post and then ignored, which is a slower poison.

Most people carry baggage that isn’t even theirs. Strings tied to money—where it comes from, who it flatters, what it expects in return. Advice pumped into them by industries that exist only because human insecurity is renewable energy. Advertising that behaves like a parasite with excellent graphic design. Then the internal traps: adolescent dreams that refuse to grow up, fantasies of effortless triumph, the belief that one dramatic gesture will rewrite your story the way films do, with a swelling violin and a convenient cut to black.

The problem with adulthood—real adulthood, not the moustache-and-EMI version—is that it doesn’t arrive with a certificate. It’s a creeping recognition that the belt is moving whether you’ve made peace with it or not. That you can’t reverse it. That “later” is a story we tell ourselves so we can take a nap inside a burning building.

Physics, in its cold-hearted politeness, calls this the arrow of time. Entropy increases; the universe gets, on average, more scrambled, more statistically messy, more like a North Calcutta storage room where nobody knows what any box contains but everyone is sure it contains something important. We feel this as aging, memory, regret, the peculiar pain of realizing you can revisit a street but never re-enter a moment. Boltzmann gave us a number for it, and people talk as if putting a number on a thing makes it less haunting. It doesn’t. It just gives the haunting a unit.

# The Singularity of Incompetence

But here’s where my metaphor starts misbehaving—because metaphors always do, if you keep them on the leash long enough.

A conveyor belt is supposed to move at a steady speed. Predictable. Industrial. A comfort, in a depressing way. Yet lately the belt feels like it’s accelerating—not in the science-fiction sense where everyone gets jetpacks and universal basic income and a tasteful Scandinavian kitchen, but in the grim socio-economic sense where the floor under your feet turns into one of those moving walkways at airports and you realize half the passengers are sprinting with luggage and the other half are being dragged backward while a loudspeaker cheerfully announces, “Please mind the gap.”

People toss around the word “singularity” the way aunties toss around “brain stroke”: as a dramatic noun for things they don’t understand but feel entitled to fear. In mathematics, a singularity is not a mystical portal; it’s a point where your equations stop behaving—divide by zero, go to infinity, cease to give sensible output. In culture, we’ve achieved something similar: systems that once produced tolerable answers—education, employment, public institutions—are now spitting out garbage with great confidence. Undefined, but with a press conference.

I look back at 2025 and the brutal part is not that it was hard. Hard I can handle. Hard is honest. The brutal part is how eerily similar it is to 2024 for me: the same stalled projects, the same tired body that needs maintenance like an old Ambassador, the same mind that oscillates between sharp clarity and that foggy, underwater heaviness where even boiling water feels like a major infrastructure project.

# Boring Competence

So, when I say “prosperous,” I don’t mean “manifest wealth” (I cannot type that phrase without feeling I should wash my hands). I mean something more embarrassing and therefore more real: better decisions, made more often, with less drama attached. The kind of prosperity that looks, from the outside, like boring competence.

You wake up at a roughly consistent time. You don’t negotiate with your phone for forty minutes like it’s a hostage-taker. You eat something that didn’t come from a packet designed by a committee of addiction engineers. You move your body a little, not because you’re chasing a beach physique—Kolkata is not a beach city; it’s a moist argument—but because the brain is a biological organ and it sulks when treated like an abstract concept.

You learn one thing properly. Not “skim fifteen threads and feel informed,” but learn, with the slow dignity of repetition. One proof. One chapter. One skill. One repair you do yourself. This is a small rebellion in an economy built on making you feel behind and therefore purchasable.

Because the truth—my least popular product—is that most of us do not need a cosmic rebranding. We need fewer self-inflicted wounds. We need to stop mistaking stimulation for life. We need to stop living as if attention is a free resource, when it’s the one thing the market is actively strip-mining from your skull.

Education, in our country, often behaves like a corrupt railway timetable: huge, official, and disconnected from reality. It teaches performance, not comprehension. It rewards fluent nonsense. It produces men (mostly men) who can recite definitions like shlokas and then stare blankly when asked to apply them, because application requires admitting you might be wrong, and our culture treats being wrong as a moral failing rather than a necessary step in learning. *Bokachoda* is easier to say than “I don’t know.” And so we drown in people who always know.

Nationalism arrives on top of this like cheap icing on a stale cake. Civilizational smugness. Spiritual branding. The same old mythological syrup poured over modern problems: unemployment solved by pride, poverty solved by slogans, climate solved by prayer, corruption solved by blaming foreigners who left seventy-five years ago. This reminds me of something that was repeated in my classroom—*if wishes were horses beggars would ride*. Meanwhile the real gods—data brokers, monopolies, surveillance systems, the bored cruelty of algorithmic feeds—operate quietly, without incense, which is why everyone trusts them more.

I can’t pretend I’m outside it. I’m typing this on a machine connected to networks designed to monetize my irritation. I am, as usual, performing my disdain while using the very stage I’m heckling. *Amar chokhe dhulo diyechhe*, as my grandmother would say—someone has thrown dust in my eyes—and the dust is partly mine.

Still. The calendar flips. The fireworks happen. People insist on hope because it’s a social requirement, like washing your hands before eating with guests watching. I don’t have that kind of hope in stock. Mine comes in smaller, less photogenic packets.

Sometimes it’s just this: I notice the belt moving under my feet, and I stop pretending it isn’t.

I stand at the window. The lane is slick with winter damp and last year’s carelessness. A stray dog trots past, indifferent to numerology. Somewhere, someone laughs in that loose midnight way, half-drunk on sugar and noise. In the distance a ribbon of smoke hangs in the air, illuminated by a streetlight that flickers like a tired conscience.

Time keeps going. The belt doesn’t consult us. 2025 also felt like the last year in which a sane person can still *debate*—with a straight face, in a LinkedIn tone, between sips of office chai—whether white-collar careers are “really” dying, as if the whole thing is an opinion poll and not an autopsy; because what’s arriving isn’t “job loss” in the old cyclical sense but a phase change, the way a profession can vanish when the underlying economics and tools shift, like scribes after the printing press or handloom weavers after industrial looms, except faster, quieter, and with better branding: titles turning into fossils, entire walks of life becoming museum dioramas while the people inside them are still breathing. The clerical middle—the spreadsheet priests, the email sherpas, the PowerPoint calligraphers—are discovering they were never a class so much as a temporary arrangement between bureaucracy and cheap cognition, and now cognition has become cheaper. And everyone says, *haan haan*, blue-collar is “safe” because of Moravec’s paradox (it’s easy for machines to do calculus, hard for them to pick up a slipper), but even that is a postponement, not a pardon; once the messy sensorimotor bits start falling—robot hands that don’t tremble, vision that doesn’t get tired, systems that learn in fleets—your plumber, your warehouse loader, your driver, your electrician begins to look, from the perspective of capital, like an inefficiency with a beating heart. So if you don’t know where you stand on this curve—if you can’t feel whether you’re on the sunny side or the shadow side—then standing outside at midnight, blithely popping firecrackers like a patriotic ritual, starts to resemble villagers cheering beside a railway line because the approaching headlight looks festive, not yet understanding it’s a train that doesn’t brake for sentiment.
 

Happy New Year, 2026—may you at least have the decency to be honest about what you are.
