It started, as most awakenings do, with a violent and unconsensual fart.

Not the dainty polite ones that sneak past the buttcrack like a bored librarian late for lunch—no, this was a tectonic plate shift, a gastric Krakatoa, a gluteal demon clearing its throat in the echo chamber of a dimly lit bathroom at 3:47 am while I was squatting, slightly sideways, trying to balance my phone against the soap dish to read about how GPT-5.3 could now detect your sarcasm, your fetishes, and your insecure attachment style all while generating a legal brief *and* optimizing your blood sugar based on your retinal scan. From the toilet camera it installed last Tuesday.

And I remember thinking—mid-wipe, hand half-extended toward a roll of two-ply that had the textural integrity of termite-chewed papyrus—*people are gonna get used to this too, aren’t they?*

We always do. Like dogs slowly trained to enjoy the tickle of stainless steel up their sphincters if it vibrates and gives us dopamine points. Like some smarmy Zuckerberg clone flashing that simian grin while he explains that butt-implanted mesh routers are the next logical step in home WiFi.

We accept it.

We fucking thank them for it.

We update firmware while it's still lodged between the cheeks.

Not me, though.

I still use a rice cooker with a busted lid, a rusted spoon with a jagged edge that sometimes slices the inside of my mouth when I stir tea, and an old desktop fan that sounds like a Buddhist exorcism every time it rotates past true north. And yet here I am, surrounded by young twats who moan about GPT not generating perfect latex equations for their chemistry homework while double-fisting bubble tea and dopamine like their bodies have any intention of surviving past thirty.

The other day, a man half my age asked me why I hadn’t installed a “prostate fitness tracker.”

A fucking what?

Apparently it’s a thing now. A Bluetooth-enabled anal bead with haptic feedback that pings your Apple Watch if it detects “pelvic tension or antisocial thought patterns.”

“Totally normal,” he says. “Game-changer, uncle.”

*Uncle.*

You want me to shove a charging port up my backdoor so Tim Cook can harvest my peristaltic rhythm?

I wanted to throw my flip-flop at his face and scream the names of every extinct butterfly from the Sunderbans but instead I just stared, mouth slightly agape, like I was trying to remember if I had eaten dinner or if I was still hungry or if all hunger was just a metaphor for some other loss.

Because it’s not the tech I hate.

It’s the *acclimation*.

The instantaneous, lube-free, guiltless acceptance of the next invasive novelty.

One moment it’s ChatGPT writing cover letters, the next it’s Amazon Prime shoving deep-learning suppositories into your dog to detect sadness before it barks. And everyone adjusts faster than their attention span can reload TikTok. You show them an AI that can generate Beethoven’s 10th and they yawn, unless it also predicts their ex’s menstrual cycle or gives them stock tips while moaning in a sultry Japanese accent.

Do you remember what it was like to *not know*?

To wait?

To wonder?

I do.

I remember clicking a button and waiting for the dial-up to screech like a robot being castrated with pliers. I remember holding books—paper ones—and licking my thumb to turn pages that had been shat on by time. I remember asking questions and not finding answers. I remember living in the suspense, the rot, the sexy slowness of uncertainty.

And now?

Now I get porn targeted to my childhood traumas.

Now Siri whispers bedtime stories about financial precarity.

Now the fridge gaslights me about my BMI.

I have lived long enough to see data become lube, and lube become mandatory.

And no one blinks.

You show them an AI-powered colonoscopy drone that flies up your rectum while playing Chopin and telling you your credit score, and some chuckle-fuck at the startup accelerator says “Oh nice, does it have a freemium plan?”

We used to fear the Matrix. Now we want it to sync with our sleep cycle and pay for Netflix. And you know what’s most depressing? The ones who *resist* are even dumber. They think buying a copper pyramid and deleting Instagram makes them immune. You’re still breathing the same surveillance particles, dipshit. Your aura isn’t gonna deflect 5G butt rays.

And the worst part?

*I still participate.*

I rant and rail and hiss and moan and yet I still ask ChatGPT to help me remember what the third cranial nerve does. (It’s oculomotor, you fuckwit. Controls eye movement and a bit of pupil stuff. You knew this once.)

I still check my phone in bed before my dick even knows it’s morning.

I still swipe my metaphorical asshole for updates, waiting to be told who I am.

I am complicit.

We are all complicit.

This is not a resistance fantasy. This is a prostate exam by the future, and we’re clenching in the wrong direction.

So next time someone asks you why you look so dazed, so vague, so vacant, don’t tell them it’s depression, or aging, or your thyroid.

Just tell them your firmware’s out of date.

Tell them the metallic phallus in your soul-port got upgraded overnight and now your dreams lag by 1.2 seconds.

Tell them you’re waiting for the patch.

Tell them you’ll cry later.

Tell them you came, but you’re not sure where.

And if all else fails, just fart loud enough to drown the panic.

Because in the end, the only proof of being alive that the machines can’t copyright yet is the irregular, lonely, beautifully stupid poetry of a human fart echoing in a tiled shithole while the future politely asks to be let in through your backdoor.
