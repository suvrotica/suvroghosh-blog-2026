At 2:17 a.m. my body makes a small, humiliating announcement, not with a trumpet but with an itch, a specific itch, the kind that has a street address, the kind that doesn’t politely knock on your shoulder but grabs you by the ass and says, wake up, baba, there’s a tiny white committee meeting happening at your anus and they have a full agenda.

South Calcutta in winter is supposed to be tender. The air turns crisp like a biscuit, the ceiling fan can be lowered from cyclone to gentle gossip, the mosquitos retreat like defeated generals. But my body doesn’t do seasons the way sane bodies do; my body is a leaking government office. There is always some department on strike. One night it’s acidity, one night it’s sweat, one night it’s the knees complaining like old party workers, and now—pinworms. Bengali pinworms. Local boys. They know the lanes. They know the shortcuts. They wait until night, until the mind is already thin and sad, until you’ve had one too many cups of tea and one too many thoughts about your life, and then they crawl out like small pale punctuation marks to leave eggs around the rim of your dignity.

I lie there in the dark, scratching carefully, because even in disgrace a man tries to maintain some technique, and the room smells of old bedsheet, old books, old disappointment, and a faint ghost of last evening’s alur dom, which I ate straight from the steel bowl like a widower who has given up on plates. My phone is face-down on the pillow, glowing faintly like a guilty conscience. The walls have that winter dampness that makes everything feel like it’s been stored in someone else’s mouth. Outside, a dog barks at nothing, and I envy him because at least his problems are large enough to bite.

Pinworms are comedy written by a biologist who hates you personally. They’re not dramatic, like cancer; not cinematic, like tuberculosis; not even poetic, like cholera with its colonial history and watery horror. Pinworms are petty. Pinworms are the universe saying, you wanted meaning? Here: a millimeter-long worm with the nightlife habits of a pickpocket, coming out after you fall asleep to glue little eggs around your anus like a sickly rangoli.

And because the body is a shameless gossip, the itch drags everything with it. Memory, politics, sex, the whole rotting kitchen of the mind. You scratch and suddenly you’re eight years old again, standing in a government clinic with a line of children, each holding a crumpled slip of paper, the nurse handing out those chalky deworming tablets like communion. We swallowed them with tap water that tasted faintly of iron and municipal despair. The adults called it “kira dawa,” said it with the casualness of sweeping dust under a bed. Worms were normal. Worms were a fact of Bengal, like humidity and corruption and Tagore on calendars. Nobody made a drama. Nobody said, how are you feeling about the fact that your body is a hotel for parasites. They just said, open your mouth.

Now I’m fifty-something and still opening my mouth, but to what? To tea, to self-pity, to stale jokes, to the occasional late-night snack eaten like a thief. The worms, meanwhile, have upgraded. They’re not just worms; they are my biography in larval form. Overeducated, undersexed, living in a decaying structure, surviving on scraps, doing their work at night.

People think shame is a mental thing, but shame is physical. Shame is the sweat that comes even when it’s cold. Shame is the sudden tightening in the belly when you remember something you did in 2003 and your body flinches like it expects a slap. Shame is the way the hand hesitates before scratching, not because scratching is wrong, but because you can’t bear the fact that you’ve become the sort of man who has to scratch there at 2:17 a.m. like a mangy street dog.

And then, like the universe adding garnish to an already disgusting plate, libido wanders in. Not the glamorous libido of film heroes with oiled torsos and moral clarity, but my libido: a confused, late, poorly dressed creature that shows up when it’s least helpful, like a drunk uncle arriving at a funeral and asking where the snacks are. I’m lying in bed, scratching, thinking about microscopic eggs, and some part of the brain—some ancient lizard department—tries to start a different conversation, a horny conversation, as if arousal is an appropriate response to intestinal parasites. This is what I mean when I say the mind is not a cathedral. It’s a public toilet with a philosophy section.

I don’t want to get into details because even I have limits and I live inside this body, but let’s just say modern solitude has a way of turning desire into paperwork. You don’t have sex; you process sex. You browse. You regret. You close tabs like you’re erasing evidence. The next day you remember nothing except a vague sense of having eaten too much sugar. There is no glow. There is only the faint nausea of having collaborated with your own emptiness.

They say “libido” comes from Latin for desire, but I read somewhere—completely unreliable, probably invented by a bored priest—that it actually comes from a phrase meaning “to embarrass your ancestors.” Total bullshit, obviously. Latin doesn’t work like that. But it feels true in the only way that matters, the way your gut knows a thing before your brain can dress it up. My ancestors, those thin, stern men in sepia photographs, would look at me now: a middle-aged Bengali man in an unflattering lungi, scratching his ass in the dark, the room smelling like damp concrete and half-dead dreams, my browser history a crime scene, my muscles soft as overcooked rice. They would not be proud. They would cough politely and change the subject.

Nationalism, in this context, feels like a particularly stupid joke. All that chest-thumping talk of “strength” and “purity” and “culture,” while I can’t even keep my own ass uncolonized. That’s the thing: masculinity is sold to men here like a cheap tonic, like some ayurvedic bottle promising virility, stamina, dominance, and what it actually delivers is a paunch, a temper, and an inability to admit you’re miserable. Nationalism is like trying to come while constipated—lots of effort, lots of grunting rhetoric, no real release, and afterwards you just feel sore and lied to.

My father’s generation had a different kind of shame. They were ashamed of hunger, of poverty, of not having enough. My generation has the luxury of being ashamed of nonsense: of our bodies misfiring, of our desires turning absurd, of our brains being crowded with images we didn’t earn. The British left, yes, the flag changed, yes, but the intimate humiliations remain stubbornly local. The drains still smell. The walls still sweat. The body still does what it does. Somewhere, a municipal officer signs a file; somewhere, a worm lays an egg.

Pinworms have a science, of course, because everything has a science, even humiliation. The female comes out at night, lays eggs around the anus, and the itching encourages scratching, which spreads the eggs to fingers, to bedsheets, to doorknobs, to the whole domestic ecosystem. The life cycle is efficient in a way my own life has never been. The pinworm is a capitalist. The pinworm understands distribution.

I try to be rational about it. I tell myself: it’s common. It’s treatable. It’s not a moral failing. It doesn’t mean you’re dirty in the cosmic sense. But the body doesn’t listen to speeches. The body believes in sensation. The body believes in itch. The body believes in the cheap horror of knowing that something is living inside you and doesn’t care about your opinions.

I get up and go to the bathroom, because the bathroom is where a Bengali man goes to negotiate with reality. The tiles are cold. The light is unforgiving. The mirror is a cruel academic examiner. I look like someone who has read too many books and digested too few joys. My belly has that soft deflation of a man who once had ambition and now has only habits. My eyes look like they’ve been left in rain.

I wash my hands too long. I wash like I’m trying to erase a decade. Soap, water, soap again. I remember childhood instructions: don’t bite nails, wash hands, keep sheets clean. As if hygiene is a kind of virtue. As if virtue can protect you from biology. In Bengal we grow up believing that the body is a nuisance you endure while the mind does the important work. But the mind is just the body’s secretary, typing letters while the real boss makes noises in the gut.

Back in bed, the itch returns, because of course it does. The worms have no respect for my schedule. I shift around, trying to find a position that doesn’t make me aware of my own rear end. That’s another insult: pinworms force intimacy with parts of yourself you’ve spent a lifetime pretending don’t exist. You can ignore your ass when you’re young and busy and distracted. You can treat it as plumbing. But now, in the dark, it becomes the center of consciousness, a small cursed planet.

And because the brain is a traitor, the itch drags up old scenes like a perverted archivist. A crush from college. A woman’s laugh in a corridor. A moment on a bus when someone’s shoulder brushed mine and my whole nervous system reacted as if touched by electricity. Those were clean desires, almost sweet, almost innocent. Now desire is sticky and tired, like chewing gum stuck under a chair. Now desire comes with failure attached, like a product with a known defect.

Sometimes I think my libido isn’t even libido; it’s loneliness wearing a cheap costume. Loneliness doesn’t know how to speak, so it borrows the language of sex. It says: want, want, want, when what it means is: please, just, some warmth, some proof that you’re not completely unnecessary. But then the body chimes in with its own commentary: sweat, itch, bowel sounds, the faint ache in the hip. The romance collapses. The animal facts remain.

Somewhere in the mind, a Sanskrit line surfaces, not as wisdom but as mockery: अहं ब्रह्मास्मि. I am Brahman. Sure. Brahman with pinworms. Brahman with a belly. Brahman with a hand hovering near his ass at 2:17 a.m. like a thief. The Upanishads didn’t cover this part, did they. They skipped the itching.

I fall asleep in patches. Half-dreams. Little dips into unconsciousness like a man trying to escape through a series of tiny doors. In one dream I’m back in North Calcutta, the old lane, the smell of frying oil and damp brick, and my mother is calling me in for dinner and everything is warm and normal. Then I wake up and I’m here, exiled in concrete, with a body that feels like a badly maintained apartment: something always leaking, something always crawling.

In the morning, the sunlight arrives like an accusation. The bedsheet is rumpled. The air is cold enough to feel clean, which is a lie. I sit up slowly, feeling the weight of my own flesh, and I think: this is the real autobiography, not the degrees, not the books, not the political opinions, not the clever rants—just the body and its ridiculous rebellions. A man can call himself rational, atheist, leftist, skeptic, whatever. Then a pinworm scratches its tiny signature into your night and you remember who’s really in charge.

I shuffle to the kitchen, make tea, stand there in my old T-shirt, stirring sugar like I’m dissolving evidence, and I feel, for one brief second, the absurd urge to be dignified. To be above it. To be the kind of man who has “principles.” Then my body gives a small warning itch—just a hint, a reminder, a wink from the microscopic underworld—and I stand there, alone with my tea, thinking of all the great speeches men make about nation and honor and purity, while my own private flagpole can’t even stay upright reliably, and my ass is basically an egg-laying beachfront property.
