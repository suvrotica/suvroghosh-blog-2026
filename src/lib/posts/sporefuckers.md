It looked like a uterus drawn by a schizophrenic mosquito with a charcoal kink.

I mean the sketch, yes, but also my life.

Two faces—both moustached, both masculine, both farcical reflections of each other like government and opposition humping in sync while pretending to swordfight. One smug in his smugness, the other furious in his fury, like two versions of constipation: the clenching and the denial. They glare across a shared womb of spores—those stippled black bursts that look like the kind of thing you find on a corpse when you dig it up too late for an autopsy but too early for forgiveness.

This isn’t just a standoff.

This is theatre. This is the pointless, masturbatory debate culture of the subcontinent. This is Times Now and its five-paneled orgy of sound. This is two sides of the same coin trying to scratch each other’s eyes out, unaware that the coin is melting in acid. And I’m stuck in the middle, not as a referee but as collateral damage. Fungally impregnated by the sheer dumbness of it all.

Because here’s the real twist of the knife: when you suppress nuance, when truth becomes this moist, contaminated afterthought, the quarrel becomes the main dish. The performance becomes policy. The spore-field in the middle, the symbolic womb of their shared idiocy, isn’t a battleground. It’s a **breeding ground**.

Every time they face off, something new and more diseased is born.

The new sedition bill.
The new god.
The new enemy.
The new show.

And I, unfortunate observer, am reduced to piss-stream epistemology—trying to decode national collapse while my urethra burns slightly from too much black tea and not enough dignity.

There’s no balance here.
No opposition.
Only **mirrored ego**.
Only loudness.

The kind that drowns out my bowel movements and my better judgment. The kind that spackles over history with patriotic glitter and wipes its ass with the constitution, all while claiming moral victory in the debate you didn’t ask for.

I used to think both-sides-ism was cowardice.

Now I know it’s a kindness.
Because neither side deserves a full endorsement
and both are violently committed
to losing me.

So I boil my tea till it tastes like ash.
Burn my tongue.
Sip again.
Watch them argue with each other’s reflections
as the fungus in the middle multiplies.
And I laugh.

Because one day, the spores will eat them
and I won’t even have to flush.
