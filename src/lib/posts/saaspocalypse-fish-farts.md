It began, as most mornings do, with the sensation of not quite pissing the bed but not quite not-pissing it either—more like my balls were storing up some metaphysical leakage overnight and had leaked into my dreams, damp and floral, like failed ambition and Lacto Calamine.

Not even five minutes later I am at the window, boxers bitten into my waistband like a bureaucrat with a stapler fetish, scratching an armpit that smells like powdered turmeric and colonized disappointment, watching sunlight illuminate the cracked plastic of my ancient CRT monitor from 2002, which still sits on a table made of termite shit and hope. I’m not even sure if I’m awake or simply simulating consciousness with last night’s leftover caffeine and a gutful of synthetic psyllium husk pretending to be bowel regulation. It doesn’t matter. Nothing does.

Because I was not born for this future. Not for this SaaSpocalypse. Not for the LLM vomit renaissance or whatever cock-circus they’re calling it. My mind still loads like a WordPress blog on 2G.

When I read history, which I do often because the past is safer than the present and much less likely to send you push notifications, I realize something bleakly simple: no matter how long you stare into the Abyss of Events, the abyss doesn’t blink back if you’re a nobody. I am the nobody. The turd stain on the underpants of history. The phantom fart in a crowded tram. The half-baked thought in an overcrowded syllabus that no one bothers to underline.

The future will read about 2024–2026 and talk about Nvidia and hallucination-tuned GPTs and DevTools that wrote themselves while the engineers sat fingering their bellybutton lint and calling it “cohort analysis,” but they won’t mention me. They won’t mention the man whose job was vaporized before he even learned what SaaS stood for. I always thought it meant some vague software service until someone clarified it was basically masturbation with APIs. Soothing, rhythmic, but ultimately self-involved.

But now, oh now, they are calling it the *SaaSpocalypse*, and everyone’s pretending to be surprised, like that Bengali adage about trying to hide fish with sprigs of coriander—you can bury it in all the glossy UI/UX parsley and recycled pitch decks you want, but the stink always finds you. The stink of bullshit. The stink of code that never compiled. The stink of sweatshop BPOs that sold the illusion of linguistic supremacy by teaching twenty-year-olds how to say “Hello, this is Calvin from Dallas” while sitting in Gurgaon with curry farts and fake braces.

Do you know how many calories it takes to train a transformer model to realize that most of Indian BPO English is basically nasal weaponized cringe? About 10,000 GPU-hours and an entire power station in Gujarat. And do you know what it takes to replace those jobs? One python script. Not a metaphor. A literal script. Executed by a cocksure twentysomething who thinks YAML is edgy and uses “learnings” as a plural noun without bleeding from the eyes.

Meanwhile, here I am, watching my own irrelevance congeal around me like phlegm. A sticky, unflushable reminder that I used to have a brain once. A whole fucking brain, full of theorems and Fourier transforms and humiliating erections at the worst possible time. Now I scroll, stare, stall. The neurons have unionized and gone on strike. All I produce is opinionated gas and the occasional typo.

People say change your perspective. Frame of reference. Like this is special relativity and all I have to do is hop on a moving train and voilà—I matter. But fuck that. I *don’t* matter. That’s the liberating truth. The most radical thing about the SaaSpocalypse isn’t the tech—it’s the quiet genocide of mediocre ambition. The cleansing of all those who confused productivity with presence.

Even the way they talk about it now—LLMs eating code, eating business plans, eating markets—it’s all digestive, primal. Meanwhile I can’t even digest rajma without a gas explosion that knocks over my tea pan. 

Everything that used to mean something—writing good documentation, understanding recursion, pretending to be an agile scrumlord—all gone, shredded like your dad’s porn mags during Diwali cleaning. SaaS was a packaging trick anyway. Wrapping bloated corporate toolchains in the illusion of sleekness, like slapping a condom on a turd and calling it dessert. Now even that illusion has been repossessed by GPU-drenched models trained on the tears of ghostwriters and interns.

And what does India do? We fart into the void. Our contribution to AI is mostly lawsuits, fake data, and Shankaracharya memes. Oh and prompt engineering certificates issued by WhatsApp forwards. And yet some poor chucklefuck in Rajarhat still believes he’s going to be the “Next Sam Altman of Bihar.” My sphincter tightens in disbelief.

There’s a great colonial symmetry to all of this, isn’t there? The British came with science, took spices, gave us railways and racism. Now we build the backend for white-boy software, sell our souls for a 3.7 Glassdoor rating, and when the layoffs come we act like someone stole our cow and not our fake LinkedIn lives. This is SaaS karma. This is the fish farting through the coriander.

Let me tell you a secret: even the AI doesn’t care about you. It cares about minimizing loss. You are not a variable. You are not even noise. You are the ignored null row in an abandoned SQLite table from 2011. And if your self-worth is attached to your startup or your resume or your goddamn Coursera badges, I have sad news. The GPU doesn’t need your permission to forget you.

And I haven’t even had sex in a decade.

There. That’s the sentence that floats above all this, like a turd that won’t sink no matter how many times you flush.

I sit, now, on my blue plastic stool with cracked legs and one missing cap, sipping tea that tastes like regret and boiled cotton, watching the screen of a laptop that wheezes every time I open more than three tabs, thinking about how I’ll explain this era to no one, because no one will ask, because no one will remember.

And if by some miracle someone does?

I’ll say: yes, I was alive during the SaaSpocalypse. I was there when the lights flickered and the databases bled and every other motherfucker I knew tried to pivot to AI consulting. I was there, scratching my ass and wondering what the fuck a vector database even does.

But mainly, I was waiting for my dick to fall off.

Which, going by the tingling, may already be underway.

And while we're here slathering our genitals with Vaseline-grade euphemisms about “innovation” and “partnerships,” let’s not pretend we don’t see the circular, self-sucking ouroboros of bullshit between OpenAI, Nvidia, Oracle, and Microsoft—a daisy chain of data-fueled duplicity where one sells the GPUs, the other rents the GPUs, the third hosts the GPUs, and the fourth writes press releases about GPT-powered fucking spreadsheet features while tickling each other’s taints with stock buybacks and SEC-friendly pillow talk, all while the rest of us get vaporized under the spatter of VC-cum and LinkedIn optimism. And this incestuous gangbang of staledom, mark my piss-dribbled words, is going to collapse not in the SaaSpocalypse—but in some newer, dumber, shinier Armageddon yet to be named, maybe the Promptocalypse or the CloudStroke or the Great Neural Nipple Twist of 2029—whatever it is, it’ll smell exactly like reheated tech conference lanyards and burst venture capitalist colon polyps.

Anyways, I don't have a job, am a feckless fuck, I really don't give a shit anymore about anything. Fuck them all. In fact fuck them all in the ass, and make them all fuck Trump in the end,because he's an asshole.
