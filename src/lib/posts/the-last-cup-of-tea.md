The last cup of tea of the year always tastes like it has been reheated in a municipal office—lukewarm, slightly resentful, faintly metallic, as if the spoon has opinions. The cup sits on my table with that brown ring the world’s laziest cartographer leaves behind, a little coastline of tannin marking where I have been and where I am too tired to wipe. Outside, South Calcutta does its usual December performance: a damp cold that isn’t cold so much as insistent, a fog that feels like a bored clerk stamping everything “PENDING,” and a chorus of scooters coughing like old men clearing their throats before announcing they are still alive.

It is 31 December 2025, which sounds like a date from a science-fiction paperback printed on cheap paper that yellows faster than my optimism. The calendar says end of year; my body says end of attention span; my mind says, as always, end of something, begin of something, who cares, the kettle is whistling again. Somewhere in the building a child shrieks and someone laughs too loud, as if volume could bribe time into being generous.

On the floor near my chair lies the true religious object of my house: an old speaker, scuffed and slightly leaning, with a wire that has been re-twisted so many times it resembles a family tradition. I press play, and the room fills with that particular kind of music that refuses to be merely sound—old songs that arrive with their own weather, their own perfume, their own ghostly furniture. The singer’s voice has the warm fatigue of someone who knows life is a losing argument but insists on making it eloquent anyway.

### The Problem of Presence

And this is the problem. My moments of ambition, love, longing—those feverish little hand-made fireworks—are not here with me in this room. They are elsewhere, filed away in the past like brittle documents in a steel almirah. The present is a crumbling façade, a set that looks convincing until you lean on it and it politely collapses. The future is a murky unknown, full of premonitions that behave like mosquitoes—tiny, persistent, and impossible to reason with.

I know the fashionable thing to do on the last day of the year is to perform hope. Hope has become an industry: you dress it up, you post it, you hashtag it, you pretend it’s a muscle rather than a mood. But I can’t do the TED-talk ending. My brain refuses that kind of clean narrative, the way my tongue refuses cheap sweetener. My life—these recent years—has been a string of ghastly vegetative seasons where I slowly fade and dissolve in the abject indifference and poverty of feelings and circumstances, dying undramatically, not with a tragic flourish but with a small squelching whimper of cogs that have all come loose beyond any screwdriving this middling age can now invent.

“Vegetative.” A loaded word, isn’t it. We use it to insult, as if a plant is a lesser citizen of the universe. But plants do not pretend. A plant does not announce it is “reinventing itself” in Q1. A plant takes light, makes sugar, tries not to die, and occasionally produces something beautiful without needing to tweet about it. My own vegetative years, unfortunately, have lacked even the dignity of photosynthesis.

### Nostalgia as a Drug

Still, I press play again. Nostalgia is a funny chemical reaction. People like to treat it as a harmless misty-eyed indulgence, a harmless habit like keeping old ticket stubs. But nostalgia is not a souvenir shop; it is a drug. It is both analgesic and poison, which is the best kind, because it feels like medicine while it rots something important. There’s a famous etymology: *nostos* (return home) and *algos* (pain). Pain of return, or pain because you cannot return—take your pick, both are accurate in the way a slap is accurate. The folk version you hear in drawing-room conversations is that nostalgia is “sweet memory.” Sweet? Only if your sugar comes with glass shards.

The brain, in its infinite bureaucratic wisdom, stores the past not as a faithful archive but as a reconstruction. The hippocampus—named after a seahorse because anatomists sometimes have the souls of poets—doesn’t replay your life like a film; it rebuilds it like a cheap contractor, using whatever materials are lying around: fragments, emotions, smells, the rhythm of a tune. Every time you remember, you edit. You aren’t visiting the past; you’re rewriting it. Which means my addiction to old songs is not even an addiction to what happened. It is an addiction to what I have managed to reassemble from what happened, the way a child rebuilds a broken toy and insists it was always meant to look like that.

I sit in this room and let an old tune wrap itself around me like a shawl. Not a fashionable shawl—some frayed, faithful thing with holes, the kind my mother would insist still has “a few more winters left.” The song doesn’t simply remind me of a happy past. It manufactures one. It takes the scattered, contradictory debris of my life and arranges it into a scene that looks, for three minutes and forty seconds, like meaning.

Then the song ends, and the room returns, with its damp walls and its minor humiliations—the buzzing tube light that flickers like it has existential doubts, the ceiling fan wobbling as if it too is aging badly, the smell of last night’s rice pretending not to be stale.

### The Clock That Colonized My Skin

Time, in Bengal, has always had two faces. One is the intimate time of adda, the elastic afternoon that stretches and folds around conversation, the time that says: sit, drink tea, argue about politics, pretend you are not mortal. The other is imported time: the railway timetable, the office punch-in, the Greenwich line slicing the world into obedient slices. We like to make mythological noises about ancient wisdom, but modern India runs on British-era time discipline and American-style hurry, with a side of WhatsApp anxiety.

We inherited clocks the way we inherited bureaucracy: not because it suited our souls, but because someone else’s machine demanded that our bodies be predictable. The colonial project was not only about land and loot, it was about synchronizing chaos into something billable. And I—science-and-math brained, rationalist, atheist—should admire the elegance of it. Standard time is a triumph of coordination. It is also a kind of leash.

On the last day of the year, the leash becomes visible. Everyone stares at the same numbers, waiting for the moment when one digit changes and we all pretend that matters. Midnight: the world’s most overrated boundary condition.

My own relationship with time has become mechanical in the worst way. Not the satisfying mechanical of a well-made watch, but the mechanical of a cheap wall clock where the second hand jumps unevenly, pausing, lurching, as if it too is unsure whether it wants to continue. My inner cogs feel loose. The screws are stripped. The screwdriver—this middling age, this tired will—keeps spinning without purchase.

I try to diagnose myself like a broken appliance. Perhaps it is dopamine. Perhaps it is the reward circuitry, conditioned by intermittent reinforcement—old songs as little pellets of comfort. Perhaps it is depression: a narrowing of the future, a collapse of possibility space. Perhaps it is simply the mundane tragedy of being human: you do not get to keep the same self across decades, but you are forced to inhabit the same skull as if it were a permanent address.

### A Brief Detour Into Untruth

Somewhere on the internet, a confident person is currently claiming that the word “anachronism” comes from some Sanskrit root meaning “timeless soul” or “ancient vibration” or some such linguistic crime. India loves debunked etymologies the way it loves gods with complicated family trees—more heads, more arms, more excuses. The truth is less mystical and more boring: Greek roots, *ana-* and *chronos*, against time. Against time. A lovely phrase, actually. The trouble is that being “against time” in real life does not make you a rebel; it makes you late.

My addiction to old songs is not an aesthetic preference. It is an anachronism with side effects. These tunes stir nostalgia for a happiness I have left behind, yes, but also for a version of myself that had not yet become this ongoing experiment in slow dissolution. When I hear those voices—Hemanta, Kishore, Lata, Rafi, a whole era of throats turned into national furniture—I do not just remember the past. I remember the concept of a future I once believed I had. Back then, the future was not a murk; it was a corridor. Now it feels like a pond at night: you can’t see the bottom, and you suspect something is moving.

People will tell you, cheerfully, to “live in the present.” This advice is often delivered by the kind of person who has a stable present. My present is a crumbling façade. Living in it feels like choosing to sit inside a building you can hear cracking. The past, at least, has already collapsed; it cannot surprise you. The future, at least, has not yet had the chance to disappoint you. The present is the only place where disappointment has immediate access.

I catch myself drifting toward a cliché—the aging melancholic man, the last day of the year, the old songs, the sigh, the self-pity—and I feel my own internal heckler clearing his throat. Really? This is what you’re doing? You’re becoming a greeting card for despair? Fine. Let me swerve.

### The Signal in the Hiss

Instead of imagining my life as a tragic narrative, imagine it as a badly maintained machine in an overworked municipal plant. The machine’s purpose is unclear. The original engineer has retired. Replacement parts are counterfeit. The operator (me) keeps applying more grease (songs, nostalgia, distractions) to a system that may need an entirely different redesign. Somewhere a bolt is missing, and the whole apparatus shudders in that ominous way that suggests nothing dramatic will happen—no explosion, no heroic failure—just gradual inefficiency until one day someone switches it off and forgets it ever mattered.

That’s my fear, really: not death, but the undramatic fade. The small squelching whimper. The cogs coming loose in silence.

And yet—here is where contradiction walks in, uninvited, wearing muddy sandals and acting like it owns the place—I still have a sensitivity to beauty that refuses to die on schedule. The old song finishes, and for a moment the silence that follows has shape. It’s not empty; it is held. The room is still the room, the damp still damp, my life still my life, but something in me has been tuned, briefly, the way an old radio suddenly catches a station clearly and you wonder if the universe has apologized.

Maybe that is all music ever was: a hack. A way to borrow coherence for a few minutes. A way to feel, briefly, like you are not merely enduring time but inhabiting it.

Bengali has a word, *obhiman*, which people translate as “hurt pride” or “resentment,” but it is more tender and uglier than that: the wounded sulk of someone who wanted love to be simple and got the complicated version instead. I have *obhiman* toward the future. I feel it owes me something it never promised. I feel cheated by a contract I signed with my own optimism in youth, when I didn’t read the fine print.

Outside, someone lights a premature firecracker—an impatient little bomb, as if the neighborhood is trying to bully the calendar into flipping early. The sound bounces off the buildings and comes back tired. I imagine the city as a giant diaphragm, inhaling smoke and exhaling noise, keeping itself alive by sheer habit.

I look at the tea ring on the table. That small brown circle is, in its own ridiculous way, a perfect model of time: evidence of presence, leftover from heat, inevitable stain. You can scrub it out, yes, but another ring will appear tomorrow if you keep drinking tea, which I will, because I am Bengali and because even atheists need rituals.

A minute before midnight—whatever “midnight” means in a country of power cuts and variable water pressure—I reach down and twist the speaker wire again, a small act of maintenance, a tiny defiance against entropy. The wire holds. The song begins. The old voice returns, calm as a river that doesn’t care about my theories.

In the distance, fireworks start up like distant artillery, the city pretending it is celebrating rather than merely surviving.

I sit back, listen, and let the year end the way it always ends: not with revelation, not with redemption, but with the soft hiss between stations—proof that something is still transmitting, even if the signal is faint.
