<Pi src="IMG-20251030-WA0003(1).jpg" />  

The first time I pitched, really *pitched*, as in stood under a tubelight halo in a room that smelled like wet socks and stale Domino’s, sweating through my ass and shirt at the same time, I was showing off a working HIE prototype written in real code with real data from real clinics—not demo bullshit, not lorem ipsum dashboards, not some Harvard dropout’s fever dream about democratizing diagnostics via WhatsApp chatbots and goat farts.

It was *real*. I had spent years in that shit—years. Wrestling with HL7 like it was a wounded street dog that kept biting back, trying to make sense of blood panel structures from Bihar, doctor notes written in SMS shorthand, prescription handwriting that looked like post-stroke Sanskrit. Built adapters, studied standards, wrote Python and SQL until my fingers cracked. I’d worked in the systems. I knew where the bodies were buried—digitally and literally. Half the EHRs in this country are duct tape over COBOL with a JPEG stapled to it.

And when I finally, finally had something that could move records, clean data, expose APIs, show goddamn meaning from the rubble of Indian health infrastructure—

They stared at me like I’d shat on their pitch decks.

The investor—some sweaty fucker in a FabIndia kurta who’d read *Zero to One* exactly once and was now pretending to be allergic to SQL—asked me if I could “pivot to blockchain.” Said it’d be easier to raise funds if I slapped an AI sticker on it. Maybe put a woman on the team for diversity optics. Maybe get an “NRI advisor.”

Motherfucker.

This wasn’t some idea I cooked up between TEDx talks and Tinder dates. It wasn’t a glorified PDF. It was built from the floorboards of public hospitals, from the thick moldy breath of ward boys and the biro scratches of overworked Bengali general physicians who still call fever “viral.” It was ugly, usable, minimal. And dead on arrival.

Because here’s the thing no one tells you:

In India, every startup pitch room is a theater production. You dress up in your best LinkedIn drag. You pretend you’re building the next E=mc² when in fact you’re squatting in a ₹5,000/month Sealdah mess with someone else’s Aadhaar card, quoting Naval Ravikant while your bank account has ₹12.50 and a bounced electricity bill. Your cofounder has a fake IIM degree, your website is made on Canva, your traction is two bots and your cousin in Gurgaon.

And the money men?

Oh, the money men.

They’re even worse.

They’re not VCs. They’re not angels. They’re not even devils. They’re just horny chartered accountants in disguise, wearing Ray-Bans and faking term sheets, looking for the next victim to gaslight with words like “synergy,” “unit economics,” and “market capture.” Half of them couldn’t tell HL7 from HIV. One told me I should rename the product to something more “Indian emotional.” What the fuck does that even mean?

But I kept going. 

Pitched in tech parks, malls, sweaty offices in Madhapur where the fan doesn’t work and the receptionist doubles as the pitch jury. Shared rides with kids whose only credential was a fake MIT email. Saw pitch decks with spelling mistakes in *“innovation.”* Watched the same five fake incubators recycle the same five fake success stories about an app that sends reminders to drink water but is now "valued at 20 crore."

All around me: the cosplay.

This was 2014 to 2016. UPA was still farting into the wind, Aadhaar was metastasizing like a tumour with no data rights, and every second cockroach in a shared flat had become a “founder.” People building “Uber for Pharmacies,” “Tinder for Pathology Labs,” “AI-enabled cancer risk via tongue selfies.” And me—idiot me—trying to solve real problems like referral loops and district hospital handovers, trying to convince Andhra Pradesh IT department that interoperability isn’t a fucking yoga pose.

I should’ve just made a skin-lightening filter app and faked my way into Y Combinator.

Instead, I watched my own work die like a lonely dog under a car. No obituary. No closure. Just silence, unpaid bills, and a bunch of unread follow-up emails bouncing in some bureaucrat’s junk folder.

I came back to Calcutta.

And that’s when I saw it.

One of the assholes I’d met in Hyderabad, who used to crash on someone’s floor and couldn’t code to save his life, was now giving LinkedIn sermons about “vision-driven impact.” Said he’d “successfully exited” his last startup—which I *know* was just a Facebook page for blood donation. He lives near Sealdah. Still. Under a fake company name. Probably wears a suit in his own bathroom.

Another one, who once asked me what an API *stood for*, is now an “AI founder-in-residence” for some American accelerator whose website looks like it was made in Microsoft FrontPage by a drunk goat. He keeps tweeting about grit.

And here I am.

Fifty. Bitter. Awake at 3:17 AM with acid reflux and a resentment rash, scrolling through these fuckers’ VC daydreams while I reheat daal in a rice cooker and wonder if my resume should just say "Failure, but eloquent."

This ecosystem is not a garden. It's a sewage pipe with glitter.

And we, the genuine, the stubborn, the assholes who actually *built*, are just floating turds being passed over for shinier shit.
