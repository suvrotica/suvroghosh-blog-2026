The first thing I do some mornings—before tea, before the phone, before I allow the day to start selling me its bargains—is wipe the window ledge with an old cloth that used to be white and is now the color of resigned paperwork.

The cloth comes away black. Not “a little dusty.” Not “needs cleaning.” Black as if I’ve been petting a chimney. And this isn’t a factory district, not some Dickensian montage with earnest men carrying sacks and coughing in solidarity; it’s just a lane in the south Calcutta boondocks where life is supposed to be ordinary, which is exactly the problem, because ordinary has become a slow intake of soot as a lifestyle, a daily sacrament administered by traffic, trash fires, diesel generators that cough like tubercular gods, and the general belief that the air is a free dumping ground because *it looks empty*.

I rinse the cloth under the tap. The water runs gray, then darker, then a kind of embarrassed charcoal. I stare at it the way a person stares at a medical report they don’t quite understand but already hate, and a thought arrives—quietly, smugly, like it’s been waiting behind the curtain the whole time.

Entropy.

Not the polite entropy of textbooks that behaves itself and doesn’t mention bodily openings. The street entropy. The entropy that comes in through every gap, every crack, every unsealed lid, every moral compromise, every underfunded municipal pipe, every lazy little “eh, what can you do” that becomes a national motto. The entropy that doesn’t need malice. It only needs neglect.

I wipe again. More black.

A man can get sentimental about many things—books, music, old streets, lost people—but soot is not one of them. Soot is the universe leaving fingerprints on my home. It is the outside becoming inside. It is high entropy staging a small, daily invasion, like an occupying force that doesn’t even bother with tanks because it has discovered something more effective: permanence.

## The Second Law and the First Lie

The Second Law of Thermodynamics is one of those ideas that feels both cosmic and insultingly obvious once it clicks. Heat flows from hot to cold. Energy spreads out. Systems drift from fewer arrangements to more arrangements because there are simply more ways to be messy than to be neat. The universe doesn’t “prefer” disorder in the way a person prefers tea over coffee; it just has arithmetic on its side. Probability is a battering ram.

And the first lie—my own lie, the one my mood slips into like an old shirt—is to take this as moral news. *Everything decays, therefore everything is pointless.* That’s not physics; that’s depression doing fan-fiction with science.

Physics is colder, and in a perverse way kinder. It doesn’t say “you’re doomed.” It says: if nothing is done, drift happens. If energy is applied, order can be made locally—briefly, beautifully, expensively—at the cost of dumping entropy somewhere else. A refrigerator keeps milk cold by making the back of the fridge warm. A city keeps a gated community pristine by pushing the mess outward, sometimes literally outward, sometimes onto invisible labor, sometimes into the lungs of the poor, sometimes into groundwater, sometimes into a distant landfill where the garbage can become someone else’s problem.

I am standing at my sink washing soot out of a cloth, which is not a philosophical act, but my brain—this overeducated parasite living on my skull—insists on making it one.

Low entropy is hard to defend. High entropy doesn’t need to strategize. It just needs to seep.

The body knows this instinctively. The body has pores, openings, membranes, gates. The body’s entire existence is a siege: keep the inside *inside*, keep the outside *outside*, filter, filter, filter. And yet, day after day, air goes in, water goes in, food goes in, viruses go in, microplastics go in, noise goes in, propaganda goes in, dread goes in. Something always gets through. That’s the nature of openings. That’s the nature of being alive: a controlled leak.

I think of the crude, juvenile line my brain likes because it’s shamelessly accurate: entropy tries to invade through any orifice, oral nasal anal. And yes, it’s vulgar. It’s also honest. Because if I strip away the poetry, that’s what living is: defending a boundary with imperfect tools in a world that never stops pressing.

## Filters, Castles, and the Cult of Maintenance

The rich have solved entropy the way the rich solve everything: by hiring other people to fight it for them.

Not always directly, of course. Nobody writes “anti-entropy staff” on a payroll sheet. It’s called housekeeping, security, compliance, legal, PR, medical concierge, nutritionist, driver, IT, gardener, “facility management” (a phrase so antiseptic it could be a surgical instrument). An army of maintainers. A thousand tiny acts of order performed daily so that the castle can remain a castle.

A billionaire’s life is a low-entropy bubble wrapped in redundancy. Filtered air, backup power, multiple homes, private water, private health care, the ability to replace anything that breaks without thinking about the cost, the ability to remove risk by buying distance from it. The moat is real. It is not metaphorical. It is infrastructure plus money plus the social permission to be insulated.

My life—middle-class Bengali, fifty, bookish enough to be a nuisance, under-wealthy enough to be one bad event away from panic—does not come with that insulation. My life is porous. The lane is porous. The city is porous. India is porous in the most humiliating way: porous not to good ideas and scientific temper and civic competence (those face visa issues), but porous to scams, adulteration, theatrical ideology, and the lazy belief that rules exist mainly for other people.

Porosity is how entropy wins socially. It doesn’t always arrive as an explosion. It arrives as leakage. A small corruption. A small shortcut. A small negligence. A small lie told in a meeting. A pipe that isn’t repaired. A budget that’s diverted. A regulation that’s announced and then quietly ignored. A school that teaches rote instead of thought. A doctor who gives antibiotics like sweets because the patient wants “something strong.” A citizen who learns that complaining is futile and silence is safer.

Each leak is small. Together they are a flood.

The cloth in my hands is proof. Black water swirling down the drain, and I’m supposed to pretend it’s normal because it’s been normal for long enough.

## AI as Thermodynamic Policy

The nightmare people like to sell is cinematic: the machine wakes up, declares humans obsolete, and marches us into the sea. It’s a comforting story in a way, because it gives disaster a villain with a face.

Reality doesn’t need drama. Reality is a spreadsheet.

Capitalism doesn’t require an artificial mind to become crueler. It only needs tools that make labor cheaper, faster, more controllable. That’s the whole evolutionary pressure of the system: reduce friction, increase predictability, maximize output, minimize cost, and call it “efficiency” as if efficiency were a moral virtue rather than a technical property.

Humans are friction. Humans are noise. Humans are complications. Humans get sick. Humans get angry. Humans unionize. Humans have children. Humans have moods. Humans have inconvenient consciences. Humans show up late because the bus became a moving argument with physics. Humans ask for dignity, and dignity is not a line item that shareholders enjoy.

Machines—software machines, automated workflows, models that generate text and images and code—do not demand dignity. They demand electricity, cooling, and maintenance, which are problems money knows how to solve. A machine doesn’t need lunch breaks. A machine doesn’t develop “attitude.” A machine doesn’t say “I’m burnt out.” It simply stops when power stops, and then it resumes when power resumes, like a perfect little soldier of productivity.

So the future doesn’t need AGI. It needs enough automation to make a large class of jobs *unnecessary* from the point of view of profit. A call center that can be partially replaced. A back office that can be streamlined. A junior writer replaced by a template. A paralegal’s first draft done by a model. A teacher’s grading automated. A programmer’s boilerplate produced in seconds. A whole economy of “good enough” output where the human gets pushed to the margins—not because the machine is better in some grand, Platonic sense, but because the machine is cheaper and doesn’t complain.

This is not a robot uprising. This is entropy disguised as innovation. It’s the system finding a way to shed human complexity, which is the most entropy-producing element from the point of view of management.

The irony, of course, is that the system is *also* creating new complexity: energy demand, data centers, surveillance, algorithmic control, the concentration of power in fewer hands. But complexity at the top is tolerated if it increases control. Complexity at the bottom is punished if it increases unpredictability.

So the low-entropy castle grows higher walls. The high-entropy outside grows louder.

## 2026, the Calendar as a Doom Object

The anxious mind loves dates. Dates make chaos look schedulable, like doom with a calendar attached. I can hear my own brain doing it: *2026 is when it breaks.* As if history consults a wall calendar before it decides to misbehave.

I don’t know what will happen in 2026. Nobody does. Prophecy is mostly a side-hustle. But I can smell the ingredients that make social heat: young people whose expectations were inflated by the BPO dream, by the outsourced-middle-class fantasy that India would become a global office with air-conditioning; an education system that too often produces credentialed obedience instead of adaptable thought; a labor market that can’t absorb the sheer mass of ambition; a politics that has discovered that theatre is cheaper than governance.

For a while, you can cake the news in bhajans and patriotic jingles and the whole devotional fog that turns reality into myth. A population can be lulled with spectacle, with slogans, with the narcotic of belonging—বাংলা, দাদা, the motherland, the gods, the destiny, the civilizational mission, the promise that suffering is meaningful because it is “for something.”

But a stomach is rude. It does not respect mythology. It respects calories. Rent. Medicine. The humiliating arithmetic of survival.

When that arithmetic fails for enough people, the noise begins. Then, inevitably, the thwack thwack of force trying to reassert order, because force is the quick tool. Competence takes time. Competence is boring. Force photographs well.

And I can already feel the temptation my own mind has: to romanticize collapse as cleansing, as revolution, as justice. That temptation is a kind of mental pornography. Real collapse is mostly misery. Real revolt is mostly bodies. Real chaos is mostly people who have no ideology at all, just fear and hunger and adrenaline.

I don’t want any of that. I also don’t want the current slow suffocation to continue. These are the two terrible options my brain presents, like a sadistic waiter offering only poison or starvation.

## Complicity, Laziness, and the Inner Leak

Here is where I have to turn the knife toward myself, because it’s too easy—too delicious—to blame everything on billionaires and politicians and capitalism and machines and “the system,” as if I am a pure victim floating above history like a moral balloon.

I am not.

I have wasted years. Not in the romantic scholar way. In the stupid way. The procrastination way. The doomscrolling way. The “I’ll start tomorrow” way. The way where I bargain with my own life as if time is a renewable resource and not a one-way burn.

I have been vain. I have wanted recognition without the discipline of being consistently useful. I have wanted to be seen as intelligent without doing the boring, repetitive work that turns intelligence into value. I have wanted the world to notice me while I hid from the world.

I have been afraid. Afraid of trying. Afraid of failing. Afraid of being laughed at. Afraid of being ordinary. Afraid, oddly, of success too—because success would require responsibility, and responsibility is another kind of low-entropy structure, demanding maintenance.

And then there is the bipolar texture, which is not romantic and not a superpower and not a quirky personality trait, but a lived condition that colors everything. Some days my mind is a carnival: connections, metaphors, ideas, a sense that I could rebuild the world with a pencil and a cup of tea. Other days my mind is a drained swimming pool: nothing echoes, nothing matters, everything is heavy. In both states, I am unreliable. In both states, my perception lies in different ways.

The hypomanic brain lies by promising effortless transformation. The depressed brain lies by declaring all effort pointless.

Both are, in their own way, high-entropy invasions. They breach the boundary of intention.

And I know the little rituals I do—rewriting drafts, deleting paragraphs, rearranging sentences like furniture—are partly therapy, partly compulsion, partly a way of pretending I’m in control of *something* when the larger world feels like it’s slipping.

I can spend an hour perfecting a paragraph while ignoring the fact that my life needs structure the way a lung needs air.

That is my own leak. My own porosity. My own entropy.

## Social Entropy Is Just Physics with Feelings

I keep coming back to the same ugly clarity: societies are just systems. Systems need maintenance. Maintenance costs energy—human energy, financial energy, institutional energy. If maintenance is neglected, entropy rises. Pipes break. Trust breaks. Schools decay. Police become predators. Hospitals become lotteries. Regulation becomes theatre. News becomes incense.

The tragedy is that humans are terrible at maintenance because maintenance is boring. Maintenance doesn’t feel heroic. Maintenance doesn’t win elections. Maintenance doesn’t go viral. Maintenance is the quiet work that prevents catastrophe and therefore never gets credit because the catastrophe never happens.

So the whole system drifts. And when it drifts far enough, people start looking for stories to explain the drift, because story is how the human mind survives the terror of randomness.

Religion offers a story. Nationalism offers a story. Conspiracy offers a story. Even the techno-utopian AI crowd offers a story: *don’t worry, technology will fix it.* (Technology, historically, fixes some things while breaking others, like a drunken doctor.)

My own brain offers a story too, and it’s the one I have to fight hardest: *you are doomed because the world is doomed and you are small.* That story is seductive because it absolves me. If everything is doomed, then my failures are not failures; they are mere symptoms.

That is depression’s most elegant con: it turns resignation into wisdom.

## The Petty Acts of Resistance

So what is resistance, in a world where entropy is both physical and social and psychological, where high entropy presses in from every direction like dampness?

Sometimes resistance is embarrassingly small.

It’s wiping the window ledge again tomorrow instead of letting soot accumulate until the room feels like a cave. It’s changing a filter if I can afford it. It’s wearing a mask even when it feels ridiculous, because dignity is not always looking dignified; sometimes it’s doing the sensible thing despite the social theatre. It’s reading a few pages of a book instead of bathing in algorithmic sewage. It’s sleeping on time—ha, yes, *sleeping on time*, the most laughable instruction ever given to a bipolar brain. It’s making a list and actually doing one item on it, not because the item matters in the cosmic sense but because the act of completion is a small patch on my porosity.

It’s not hope. Hope is too grand a word. It’s maintenance. It’s the humble art of not letting everything leak at once.

The rich do maintenance with armies. I do maintenance with scraps. But scraps are still something.

I think of entropy as an invading force because it helps me stay alert, but I also know that the invader is not a villain. The invader is the default. The villain, if there is one, is the human tendency to neglect the boring work and then act surprised when the roof collapses.

And yes, capitalism loves this. High entropy outside makes the low entropy inside feel more valuable. Chaos increases the price of stability. Fear makes people accept fences. A noisy world makes the castle’s quiet more seductive. This is how inequality reproduces itself: not only through exploitation, but through the sale of protection.

## The Body, Again, Because It Never Lets Me Forget

By the time the cloth is rinsed and wrung out, my fingers smell faintly metallic. The cloth hangs from a hook to dry, drooping like a defeated flag.

I wash my hands longer than necessary. I can’t wash the air. I can’t wash the economy. I can’t wash the politics. I can’t wash the trajectory of automation that treats human beings as inefficiencies to be optimized away. I can’t wash the future. I can barely wash my mood.

But I can wash my hands. So I do it, partly out of hygiene and partly out of superstition, as if cleanliness were a form of moral persuasion.

The body keeps insisting on itself. The body is not interested in ideology. The body wants breathable air and potable water and stable glucose and sleep. The body is the ultimate anti-myth machine. The body does not care about civilizational greatness when it can’t inhale without thinking about it.

And that’s where the darkest tenderness creeps in, the one I don’t like admitting because it makes me feel soft: the fragility is shared. Not equally—nothing is equally shared in this world—but widely. Billions of bodies, each defending its boundaries, each leaking a little, each trying to keep inside inside and outside outside.

I am not special. My misery is not rare. My intelligence—whatever quantity of it I possess—is not a shield. The universe is not impressed by my reading list.

Which should be nihilistic news. And yet, perversely, it isn’t entirely. There is a strange comfort in realizing that the drama in my skull is part of a larger biological comedy: *Homo sapiens* as a whole is a leaky organism inventing castles and slogans to pretend it isn’t.

## A Quiet Gesture That Doesn’t Pretend to Solve Anything

I go back to the window and look at the ledge. It is clean for now. A small local decrease in entropy achieved with muscle and water and time, dumping the mess into the drain where it will go become someone else’s problem, which is the story of civilization in miniature.

Outside, the lane continues. A horn. A shout. A scooter. The distant crackle of someone burning something they shouldn’t. The air looks empty. The air is not empty.

I close the window—not as a solution, just as a gesture—and for a few seconds the room feels marginally quieter, marginally more mine, marginally less invaded.

Then I do something even smaller and even more pathetic, the kind of thing no ideology can claim: I put the phone face down and pick up a book, not because books will save me, not because reading is resistance in some heroic sense, but because a page is one of the few places left where the noise doesn’t automatically win, where my attention—this battered little territory—can still be defended, sentence by sentence, like sandbags against a flood.

I read. I stop. I reread a line. I savor a word. I feel, briefly, the embarrassment of being alive and still trying.

And when the mind starts to sprint toward prophecy again—2026, collapse, thwack thwack, castles, mobs, machines—I catch it the way one catches a child running toward traffic, not gently, not kindly, but firmly, and I drag it back to the page.

That’s all I’ve got: a cleaned ledge, a drying cloth, a closed window, a book open on my lap, and a stubborn refusal to let the day take every orifice without a fight.
