The joy of pixels is a kind of civic religion now. They carry their miracles in their palms—rectangles of glass holier than thou and definitely holier than me. They wear their earbuds like talismans, crouch at bus stops in that peculiar prayer posture—head bowed, neck bent like a wilted lotus stalk—witnessing Hanuman in HDR, flying across a CG sky with tail elongated like a Sanskrit footnote, smashing problems that entire departments of the CPWD, PWD, and a thousand acronyms of failure couldn’t untangle with decades of budget and bureaucratic constipation. All in Dolby Atmos. In traffic.

Me, I stand outside this temple. Not out of pride. Just a quiet biological revulsion. Something about sacred monkey avatars doing helicopter dick moves through the air while a bass-boosted Bhajan remixed by DJ Chintu thuds through the city’s diesel-scented breeze makes me want to fart loudly and disappear into the next open drain.

Because the trouble is, the same glass rectangles are also portals to madness. One moment they’re beaming an eight-armed god cleaving demons while riding a tiger through rainbow fire. The next, they’re live-streaming a mutton shop being mobbed because someone said the animal had the wrong kind of childhood. These aren’t movies, they’re mood swings. And the people consuming them aren’t just viewers. They’re combustible. You can’t tell if that glint in their eye is awe or rage. The same thumb that hit “Like” on a saffron meme about cow purity can punch your nose flat for ordering a steak at the wrong time of day.

So I watch from a safe distance. Not because I’m above them. Because I’m scared of them. Because in this new pantheon of pixelated piety, even a sneeze in the wrong octave might be mistaken for a minority conspiracy. I don’t own an 8K screen. But I have 20/20 vision and a very healthy fear of mobs. So I mostly stay inside the safety of my own hideous hideout. 

The first sound every day is the groan of my bowels impolitely screaming that it is time to release something ancestral, something curled and crusted in the pipes of my intestines like a small dark memory of colonial trauma, and the second sound—the one I like marginally better—is the pathetic rattle of my tea pan sputtering its alloy indignity on the old stain-ringed induction stove, which I press on, and then I wait, usually naked except for my hideously fraying boxers with elastic so tired it clings to me out of habit not hope, staring at the bubbles forming on the water’s edge like malignant hope, till it's ready for the dump of dust that is my overpriced, underpowered Darjeeling blend—a misnomer really, since what’s inside that plastic pouch smells less like hills and more like dead bureaucrats soaked in larceny, greed, tannin and shame.

Two cups. Morning. Evening. Bookends to a life that never really got shelved.

It’s not joy, it’s not ritual, it’s barely survival. It's methadone. Tea-done. One dose to keep the crawling inertia of a new sunrise from swallowing my spine in mosquito-bitten dread, and one to sedate the dreary loneliness just enough that I can blink into the overhead oversized fluorescent light at 6:14 PM and say yes, yes, the light exists, and so do I, barely, like dried semen under a pillow.

Let me tell you something about Camellia Sinensis, that promiscuous little shrub that has been passed around more than a failed godman’s venerable disease. That botanical pubis is the only thing in my house that still gives me warmth without complaint. Originally Chinese, but the British—those colon-polyped imperial palefaces—couldn’t just trade for it like civilized traders, no. They had to *steal* the thicket, send in Robert Fortune, the original espionage botanist, who dressed up like a Chinese eunuch and smuggled seeds and saplings out like a two-bit gardener on crack.

They planted her in India like a flag. Assam, Darjeeling, Dooars—names I have visited as tourist while buying tea in loose wet sacks from beedi-smelling ration shop fraudsters who breathe over your neck like your last failed erection.

And now look. She’s mine.

She’s all I can afford.

She’s the only female sounding name I still interact with daily.

The first sip is godawful. It tastes like compromise. Like licking the rusted railing of a Calcutta clinic. But by the second, it becomes bearable. And by the third, I’m in. Not refreshed. Not revived. Just slightly less murderous.

Let me tell you a little secret, tea makes me fart like an 18th century cannonball factory in monsoon.

It’s not polite, it’s not genteel—it’s colon-cleansing thermonuclear magic, and every cup is a game of will-the-fart-be-just-fart. Tea doesn’t cleanse your soul. It scrapes your intestines and whispers “run.” In that sense, it’s the most honest beverage there is. Coffee is for people pretending to be alive. Tea is for those of us keeping score.

My rice cooker stares at me while I sip. We have a relationship now. I whisper to it sometimes, when the street is quiet. It’s the only warm object in this flat. 

You think I'm exaggerating. You think this is cute. It’s not. I have three shirts and one functioning sexual nipple.

But my tea—my filthy, overboiled, undersweet, bronchitis-colored tea—reminds me twice a day that time still flows. That I still flow, barely. That entropy hasn't won, not yet, not completely. Just mostly.

You know the L-theanine-caffeine curve? That magic bullet of alert calmness, like being punched in the face gently while someone reads you Bertrand Russell? Yeah, that’s real. Japanese monks used to chug this dung to meditate, because apparently you need a stimulant to sit still and stare at your own bullshit.

I respect that.

The leaf’s shape is absurdly elegant—wiry, curled, loaded with the illusion of delicacy. But you burn it, drown it, beat the flavor out of it with milk and fire and it *blooms.* You ruin it to taste it. That’s tea. That’s also my entire career. My body. My faith in democracy. Everything I ever loved had to be boiled to death before I could stomach it.

I used to think the cup was half full. Now I know the cup is stained, and cracked.

Evening tea is worse. The dusk creeps in like a guilty uncle with mold in his breath and your name on his to-do list. You sit. You sip. You stare at the lizards mating near the light switch. You fart. You remember things you didn’t want to. That tea, it doesn't take the edge off, it just makes the edge shiny and visible.

One day, I’ll probably die like this. Tea in hand. Farting. Alone.

And they’ll find me three days later when the smell competes with the drains.

And some tea leaf will still be floating, unbrewed, unconsumed.

Like my potential.
