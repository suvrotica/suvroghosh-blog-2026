<TTS />

The first sound every day is the groan of my bowels politely whispering that it is time to release something ancestral, something curled and crusted in the pipes of my intestines like a small dark memory of colonial trauma, and the second sound—the one I like marginally better—is the pathetic rattle of my mute tea pan sputtering its aluminum indignity on the old rust-ringed gas stove, which I light manually like a suicidal street magician, and then I wait, naked except for my hideously fraying boxers with elastic so tired it clings to me out of habit not hope, staring at the bubbles forming on the water’s edge like malignant hope, till it's ready for the dump of dust that is my overpriced, underpowered Darjeeling blend—a misnomer really, since what’s inside that plastic pouch smells less like hills and more like dead bureaucrats soaked in tannin and shame.

Two cups. Morning. Evening. Bookends to a life that never really got shelved.

It’s not joy, it’s not ritual, it’s barely survival. It's methadone. Tea-done. One dose to keep the crawling inertia of a new sunrise from swallowing my spine in mosquito-bitten dread, and one to sedate the loneliness just enough that I can blink into the overhead tube light at 6:14 PM and say yes, yes, the light exists, and so do I, barely, like dried cum under a stranger’s pillow.

Let me tell you something about Camellia Sinensis, that promiscuous little shrub that has been passed around more than a failed godman’s STD. That botanical twat is the only thing in my house that still gives me warmth without complaint. Originally Chinese, but the British—those colon-polyped imperial cocksuckers—couldn’t just trade for it like civilized traders, no. They had to *steal* the fucker, send in Robert Fortune, the original espionage botanist, who dressed up like a Chinese eunuch and smuggled seeds and saplings out like a two-bit gardener on crack.

They planted her in India like a slutty flag. Assam, Darjeeling, Dooars—names I can’t afford to visit but read on packs while buying tea in loose wet sacks from beedi-smelling ration shop fuckheads who breathe over your neck like your last failed erection.

And now look. She’s mine.

She’s all I can afford.

She’s the only cunt I still interact with daily.

The first sip is godawful. It tastes like compromise. Like licking the rusted railing of an STD clinic. But by the second, it becomes bearable. And by the third, I’m in. Not refreshed. Not revived. Just slightly less murderous.

Let me tell you a little secret, tea makes me fart like an 18th century cannonball factory in monsoon.

It’s not polite, it’s not genteel—it’s colon-cleansing thermonuclear magic, and every cup is a game of will-the-fart-be-just-fart. Tea doesn’t cleanse your soul. It scrapes your intestines and whispers “run.” In that sense, it’s the most honest beverage there is. Coffee is for people pretending to be alive. Tea is for those of us keeping score.

My rice cooker stares at me while I sip. We have a relationship now. I whisper to it sometimes, when the street is quiet. It’s the only warm object in this fucking flat other than the backup bulb that flickers during load-shedding like a dying firefly choking on tar.

You think I'm exaggerating. You think this is cute. It’s not. I piss in a broken commode that leaks. I fart like an artillery unit. I have three shirts and one functioning nipple.

But my tea—my filthy, overboiled, undersweet, bronchitis-colored tea—reminds me twice a day that time still flows. That I still flow, barely. That entropy hasn't won, not yet, not completely. Just mostly.

You know the L-theanine-caffeine curve? That magic bullet of alert calmness, like being punched in the face gently while someone reads you Bertrand Russell? Yeah, that’s real. Japanese monks used to chug this shit to meditate, because apparently you need a stimulant to sit still and stare at your own bullshit.

I respect that.

The leaf’s shape is absurdly elegant—wiry, curled, loaded with the illusion of delicacy. But you burn it, drown it, beat the flavor out of it with milk and fire and it *blooms.* You ruin it to taste it. That’s tea. That’s also my entire career. My body. My faith in socialism. Everything I ever loved had to be boiled to death before I could stomach it.

I used to think the cup was half full. Now I know the cup is stained, cracked, and inherited from someone who owed rent.

Once, I tried a fancy oolong from China. Cost me half a week’s ration. It smelled like orchids and sadness. I wept halfway through and flushed the rest, like a shameful wank you couldn’t finish because the Wi-Fi died mid-buffer. Never again. No hope in this household.

Evening tea is worse. The dusk creeps in like a guilty uncle with mold in his breath and your name on his to-do list. You sit. You sip. You stare at the lizards mating near the light switch. You fart. You remember things you didn’t want to. That tea, it doesn't take the edge off, it just makes the edge shiny and visible.

One day, I’ll probably die like this. Tea in hand. Farting. Alone.

And they’ll find me three days later when the smell competes with the drains.

And some tea leaf will still be floating, unbrewed, unconsumed.

Like my potential.
