I woke up today with my balls sticking to the inside of my thigh like two boiled eggs in a damp sock stapled to a rotting mango leaf, and before I could even scratch out the crusted sleep-piss from my eye corners, the gas cylinder delivery dickhead downstairs was honking like a syphilitic duck with a panic disorder, as if a country of 1.4 billion won’t shart itself to death if his iron chariot of subsidized petroleum isn’t applauded like motherfucking Vamana descending from heaven on wheels.

And yet.

The bigger humiliation wasn't the gasman’s fart symphony or the cockroach I killed on my rice cooker lid with last night's bent spoon—no—it was the brain-melting realization that *my problems*, my exquisitely neurotic, armpit-sweat-salted Bengali fucking *problems*, float in a goddamn Hilbert Space of self-loathing so vast, so infinitely more complex than the shitty little vectors that pass for public discourse in India, that if you were to take every WhatsApp forward sent by your paunchy cousin who now teaches spoken English to the unemployed, and plotted each one as a banana-shaped projection in a Euclidean fuckcube, you still wouldn’t capture the curl of my bile-smeared, acid-washed *midlife despair manifold*.

Let’s say the nation worries about “inflation” or “elections” or “border tensions” or the latest 14-page rape-murder story hidden on page 12 next to some industrialist farting carbon credits.
But me?

I'm trying to remember what my own dick looked like when I liked looking at it.
I'm trying to stand up from a plastic chair without my knees popping like two marbles in a condom.
I’m trying not to weep while microwaving leftover shukto in a cracked Borosil bowl that smells faintly of detergent and betrayal.

People say *problems are relative*—but no, motherfucker, *problems are dimensional*—they inhabit vector spaces with their own norms and inner products and I swear to Satyendra Nath Bose’s molting scalp that my set of neuroses is orthonormal and linearly independent from the daily fucknado of Modi's India™.

Take this one: I am terrified of *being touched lovingly*, not because I’m a misanthrope (though, sure, fuck most of you), but because the one time I accidentally grazed a stranger’s wrist in a Metro escalator queue, I felt a full spinal seizure of longing so intense I had to pretend I had to fart just to distract myself from the sudden urge to sob into the hem of someone’s dupatta.

How the hell does this map onto “jobs growth”?

You think your 3x increase in GDP captures the decay constant of my lust?
You think your 2.5% fiscal deficit explains the soft-porn nostalgia I feel when I touch warm lentils?
You think your Parliament motion on data localization gives a rat’s prolapsed anus about the existential tragedy of a man whose boxers have bleach stains in the shape of failed countries?

You want to understand this despair?

You need quantum mechanics.
Not the flashy *"woo-woo I am the Universe"* horse-fuckery that tech bros ejaculate over after one shroom trip in Goa, but the real shit—Hilbert spaces, infinite bases, operators that aren’t fucking your mother but measuring observables like “how many nights have you dreamt of someone’s breath?” and “how many times have you masturbated in the presence of nostalgia?”

I exist, if you can call it that, in a state vector that *superposes* failure and defiance—middle-aged, flaccid, and weirdly horny in the middle of an electrical outage where the inverter is dying and the mosquito coil is burning a hole in my mosquito net and I am still, *still*, trying to write down a list of groceries as if that’ll make me feel real.

Meanwhile, India.

India is a tesseract of honking, sweating, protesting, raping, praying, scamming, IPO-launching, temple-building, teen-suiciding, tandoori-farting madness that cannot be projected onto a fucking PowerPoint bar graph without murdering the covariance matrix of god and reason.

In India, an old man can take a shit on the street while talking about crypto.
In India, a 12-year-old can speak five languages and still die because the hospital wants an Aadhaar-linked blood group certificate.
In India, the Supreme Court can ban firecrackers while half the cities burn actual garbage on festival days and call it bhakti.

Tell me—what inner product do I use to calculate *my* contribution to this?
What basis vector includes *not opening the door for three days because I can’t bear to face the delivery boy who once saw me shirtless and sad*?

I suspect I am a boundary condition in some much larger equation nobody wants to solve.
Some fucked-up Lagrangian with too many terms—“shame,” “repression,” “ear hair,” “algorithmic depression,” “mild rectal bleeding from too much sitting,”—all minimized over the integral of a wasted life.

And don’t even get me started on noise.

Noise here is not metaphor.
It is literal: Concrete mixer churning like a cement-spitting bull with tinnitus outside my window since August 2021, and the neighbor’s child screaming like he just discovered the infinite regress of identity, while I try to poop in peace reading about Von Neumann entropy on my phone and pretending the stink isn't my own.

And I know, I *know*—someone will say “seek therapy,” like it’s a motherfucking lemon wedge you can squirt into the septic tank of existence and out will float the clean zest of recovery.

But therapy in this country is either:
(a) some half-trained auntfucker who tells you to chant Om while doodling your trauma in crayon
or
(b) a hyper-Englishized trauma influencer who recommends yoga mats that cost more than your fucking bed.

Besides, my problems are too quantum to collapse.
They shimmer.
They fuck around.

I am simultaneously aroused and ashamed, stimulated and constipated, enlightened and deeply concerned that my nipples are beginning to sag.

Every choice is a decoherence event.
Do I shower or marinate in shame a bit longer?
Do I respond to a text or pretend I didn’t see it while actively watching the typing dots disappear like tiny abandoned hopes?
Do I wipe again just to be sure, even though I already flushed and the flush itself groaned like a ghost with IBS?

This is the edge, not of the city—this is the edge of the wavefunction.

Where middle age isn’t a plateau, it’s a collapsing probability field where you still half-believe you’ll write your book, fall in love, do a pull-up, become someone again—and you won’t.

You’ll sit here with your failed dreams like piss stains on a toilet you cleaned only halfway because the brush handle snapped off.

I tried meditating once.

My thoughts screamed so loudly my ears popped and I farted in self-defense.

So no, don’t tell me about mindfulness unless you’re ready to meet the version of me that cries while washing Tupperware.

I’m not competing with the national trauma.
I’m just saying: my personal Hilbert Space has *more fucking dimensions*, and none of them can be projected without inducing nausea, erections, or a sense of moist dread.

And that’s it.

I’m going to make tea now in my scalded, soot-stained pan.

The gas ran out.

I’m boiling water on a shitty induction plate that hums like a dying sex toy.

It takes nine minutes to get hot.

I stare at it the whole time.

I never blink.
