The balcony rail is cold enough in December to feel like it has opinions.

Not grand opinions—nothing that would get a newspaper column—but small metallic judgments that seep into the skin when I lean my forearms on it and stare down at the little strip of South Calcutta street that pretends to be a road, the one where a cycle-van rattles past like a skeleton in a tin can, where the air smells like damp concrete, yesterday’s frying oil, and that peculiar winter Kolkata odor: smoke plus fog plus the sweet rot of leaves that never quite become soil because the city is too impatient to let anything finish its life properly.

A man across the lane is already shouting into his phone. There’s always a man shouting into a phone. If the universe has a background radiation, in Bengal it’s middle-aged male outrage, broadband-enabled, tariff-plan-optimized. A stray dog—thin, philosophical, perpetually auditioning for the role of “metaphor”—does that slow, careful scratching that says, *I have fleas, but also I have principles.* Pigeons clatter on a parapet and I can hear, from somewhere inside the building, the domestic percussion of steel plates meeting a sink with the passive aggression of a small war.

I’m standing there doing what I’m best at: not moving.

And then, because my brain is a cursed librarian that reshelves misery under “interesting,” the phrase pops up again—*Wu Wei*—like a smug little bookmark inserted into my day.

It’s an elegant idea, is the problem. That’s how it gets you. *Wu Wei* sounds like a soft instrument. Two syllables that could be a lullaby. It does not sound like the thing it’s often used for, which is an intellectual permission slip to let your life fossilize while you narrate the fossilization in very sophisticated language.

The lower middle-class version of this is not even sophisticated. It’s just *kal theke korbo*—I’ll do it from tomorrow—said with the calm assurance of a man who has been promising tomorrow for twenty-five years and has never met the fellow.

And I’m not exempt. I’m the specimen jar too. I can dress it up in philosophy, I can garnish it with etymology and politics and the sorrowful beauty of “systems,” but at 6:40 a.m., in winter air that tastes like a public-health warning, I am still just a mammal leaning on a rail, waiting for motivation to fall from the sky like divine bird-droppings.

# A philosophy that gets misused because it’s too pretty

*Wu Wei* is usually translated as “non-action,” but that translation is the philosophical equivalent of labeling a tiger “large cat.” True, but you’ve missed the part where it eats you.

The Chinese characters are doing more work than the English. 無 (*wú*) is “without,” “lacking,” “not.” 爲 / 为 (*wéi*) is “doing,” “acting,” “making,” “contriving.” Put them together and you get something like “without contrivance,” “without forced effort,” “without that frantic, white-knuckled pushing that makes you sweat and still go nowhere.”

Which is not the same as lying on a mattress until your mattress develops its own weather system.

The Taoist classics—*Daodejing* (traditionally linked to Laozi), *Zhuangzi* (Zhuang Zhou, who wrote like a man sleepwalking through logic and laughing at it)—came out of a China that was chaotic in a way that makes modern chaos look like a spreadsheet. Warring states, rulers, schemes, ritual correctness, and the general human hobby of mistaking domination for meaning. In that world, “effortless action” was not a celebration of laziness; it was a rejection of *performative control*.

Taoism is what you get when someone watches the ambitious wreck themselves, over and over, and decides the universe might not be impressed by hustle.

But here’s the trap: anything that sounds like cosmic permission will be adopted by every small despair looking for a robe and a halo.

I can see it clearly because I’ve done it. I’ve read a line that says, in effect, “stop forcing things,” and heard it as, “stop trying.” I have taken “don’t strangle the river” and turned it into “don’t leave the bed.” I have misread “align with the grain of reality” as “become furniture.”

Part of this is depression. Depression is a con artist that sells you a fake philosophy: *Nothing matters, so why move?* It’s a thought that feels wise because it’s quiet and heavy, like old stone. Hypomania, on the other hand, sells the opposite fake philosophy: *Everything matters, so move in all directions at once.* Between the two I live like a pendulum that thinks it’s a philosopher.

So when *Wu Wei* shows up in my mind, I have to ask: is this Laozi speaking—or is this my nervous system, tired and underfed on hope, doing ventriloquism?

# Kolkata’s physics: friction everywhere, no traction anywhere

There’s a simple mechanical truth that explains a lot of lower middle-class paralysis, and it has nothing to do with “culture” and everything to do with energy.

In physics, to move a thing from rest you need to overcome static friction. Static friction is meaner than kinetic friction; it’s the bouncer at the club door. Once you’re moving, it’s easier to keep moving. But to start—especially if the surface is rough, uneven, and possibly on fire—you need a shove.

Now take that and build a life.

When you’re broke, when your neighborhood is a slow leak, when institutions feel like theater and jobs feel like lottery tickets sold by smug men, the friction is high. Every action has hidden costs: money, time, humiliation, paperwork, social signaling, the emotional labor of being treated like you’re asking for favors instead of trying to exist.

Even deciding to try carries a tax: you might fail, and failure in a precarious life is not a lesson, it’s a crater.

So inertia isn’t just “laziness.” It’s often the rational response of an organism in an environment where effort doesn’t reliably pay. This is not me romanticizing it. It’s me noticing that bodies and brains are accountants. They track cost and reward, not in tidy numbers, but in stress hormones, sleep, appetite, and that invisible metric called “how many times have I been disappointed recently.”

Psychologists call one flavor of this *learned helplessness*—a concept Martin Seligman studied in the 1960s and 70s. The crude summary: if an animal learns that its actions don’t change outcomes, it stops acting even when action would help. The elegant horror: the animal’s “giving up” is not moral failure; it’s a model of the world.

Depression can be that model calcified into identity.

And in a city like Kolkata—where the air itself teaches you that you are not the priority—there’s a collective version. A shared shrug. A local climate of resignation that people decorate with ideology, or nostalgia, or sarcasm, or the wonderfully Bengali habit of turning despair into performance art over tea.

Which is where *Wu Wei* gets invited in as a dignified foreign guest.

“Ah yes,” says the chai-stall philosopher, stirring sugar into his cup like he’s doing chemistry for the gods. “Why run after things? The Tao says don’t force it.”

But the Tao is not your auntie’s excuse for not taking medicine. Taoism is not a bureaucratic stamp that validates your stagnation.

It is, if anything, an attack on self-importance. And self-importance is exactly what we use to justify our despair: *My suffering is special. My failure is cosmically inevitable. My inaction is intellectual.*

I’m saying “we,” but I mean “me,” too. I have intellectualized myself into a corner often enough to know the furniture by name.

# What effortless action actually feels like (spoiler: it can look like work)

The most annoying thing about *Wu Wei* is that, when you finally glimpse it, it does not look like doing nothing. It looks like competence.

Watch a skilled carpenter. Not the poetic kind from advertisements—an actual one, with forearms like arguments. When he measures, cuts, joins, the action is smooth. Not because he is lazy, but because he is aligned with constraints. He respects wood grain, tool angle, leverage. He isn’t fighting reality; he’s cooperating with it. The “effortlessness” is what action looks like when it isn’t wasted.

This is true in sports, music, mathematics, even conversation. The best move often feels like *not forcing the move*. You let the system’s own dynamics do the heavy lifting.

There’s a neuroscience angle here, if you want to ruin the romance (I do). Brains are prediction machines. They minimize error between what they expect and what they sense. When you’re learning something, your prediction errors are huge, so everything feels effortful. As you get better, the brain compresses the skill into a more efficient model: fewer surprises, smoother execution, lower metabolic cost. “Flow” states—those periods where action seems to happen without a separate “you” narrating it—are arguably the nervous system running a well-trained loop with minimal internal conflict.

That’s a plausible modern cousin of *Wu Wei*: action without the ego’s constant micromanagement.

The ego, by the way, is often a terrible manager. It is anxious, status-obsessed, and convinced that the universe is grading it. It loves to *try hard* in ways that are theatrically visible and strategically useless.

So Taoism says: stop that. Stop the frantic, grasping, performative struggle. Do what fits.

But the lower middle-class tragedy is that “what fits” is often very narrow, and the environment punishes experiments. In that situation, “don’t force it” can mutate into “don’t attempt it,” and soon you’re not practicing *Wu Wei*; you’re practicing *slow self-erasure*.

I know because I can feel the seduction in my bones. On bad days, the bed is not a bed; it’s a philosophy. The phone scroll is not a vice; it’s an epistemology: I am “staying informed.” The procrastination is not fear; it’s “waiting for the right moment.” All of it sounds clean when translated into abstract nouns.

But bodies don’t live in nouns. Bodies live in minutes.

# The Indian cousin of Wu Wei that nobody uses as an excuse

We have our own old literature about action and restraint, but we cherry-pick it like crows.

From the Īśa Upaniṣad—part of the Vedic corpus, short and sharp enough to feel like it was written by someone who hates unnecessary decoration—there’s a line that I keep returning to when my brain tries to baptize inertia:

“कुर्वन्नेवेह कर्माणि जिजीविषेच्छतं समाः”
(*kurvann eveha karmāṇi jijīviṣec chataṃ samāḥ*)

Roughly: “Doing actions here, one should wish to live a hundred years.”

It’s not saying “be a workaholic.” It’s saying: *life is not lived by withdrawal alone.* It’s a reminder that the world is not solved by sulking at it from a safe distance.

And then, a few verses later, the same text tosses a grenade into the smug face of simplistic spirituality:

“विद्यां चाविद्यां च यस्तद्वेदोभयं सह”
He who knows both knowledge and ignorance together…

The point being: reality is mixed. You don’t get to pick only the parts that flatter your temperament. You have to hold opposites without collapsing into either mania (“only knowledge!”) or nihilism (“only ignorance!”). It’s almost rude how psychologically modern it sounds.

Taoism, in its better moments, is also about holding opposites. Not forcing, but not freezing. Yielding, but not rotting.

My problem—our problem, if I’m being generous—is that we prefer philosophies that give us a clean excuse. We like systems that let us say, “See? I’m not failing. I’m *transcending*.”

Transcendence is a beautiful word that has been used, historically, to cover an enormous amount of cowardice.

# Politics as mood stabilizer, mood as politics

It’s impossible to write about Bengali stagnation—sorry, *my stagnation in a Bengali setting*, because I am not going to turn an ethnicity into a punching bag—without mentioning politics, because politics is the city’s favorite religion after cricket and pessimism.

The Left taught a whole generation to talk in grand abstractions while life continued in small humiliations. Then the counter-reaction taught us to talk in different abstractions while the humiliations continued, now with extra noise. If you’re lower middle class, politics can become a way to feel involved without being effective, like yelling at the TV and calling it cardio.

Sometimes that involvement is genuine. Sometimes it’s an alibi.

I have watched smart people become museum guides of their own resentment, explaining, with great fluency, why everything is broken, who broke it, and why the fix is impossible—while they themselves remain strangely untouched by the concept of changing a habit.

The thing about ideology is that it can be a mood stabilizer. It converts personal failure into systemic critique. The critique may even be correct. Systems are brutal. Inequality is real. Corruption is not folklore; it’s infrastructure. But the psyche loves a story where responsibility is always located elsewhere.

I say this as someone who distrusts authority on principle. I’m not here to preach bootstraps. I’m here to admit a more embarrassing truth: I can be right about the system and still use that rightness as a sedative.

That’s the worst combination—accurate diagnosis plus comfortable paralysis.

On hypomanic days, my mind becomes a firework factory. Everything connects: Taoism to thermodynamics to the sociology of tea stalls to the geopolitics of supply chains to the neurochemistry of motivation. I feel like a prophet of patterns. It’s intoxicating. Then the next day I can’t answer a phone call. The same brain that mapped the cosmos can’t map the route to a simple task.

So I become, again, a balcony mammal.

# The quiet difference between surrender and acceptance

Here’s the distinction I keep trying to tattoo onto my own mind with a blunt instrument: surrender is not the same as acceptance.

Surrender is when you stop because you believe you are powerless.

Acceptance is when you stop fighting what is true so you can act on what is possible.

They look similar from the outside. Both can be quiet. Both can involve a person sitting still. But the inner texture is different. Surrender feels like collapse. Acceptance feels like unclenching.

*Wu Wei*, properly understood, is acceptance that moves.

It’s the martial arts idea: you don’t meet force with force; you redirect. You don’t stiffen; you align. It’s softness as strategy, not softness as self-abandonment.

My version, too often, is surrender dressed as a robe.

I tell myself I’m being “philosophical,” but I’m actually being afraid—afraid of trying and discovering that my best effort is still not enough, afraid of starting and finding out I have less stamina than I imagined, afraid of the banal truth that improvement is mostly repetition and boredom, not revelation.

Taoism is full of water metaphors because water is patient and strong and does not argue with rocks. But water also *moves*. It doesn’t sit in a corner congratulating itself on being moist.

If I’m honest, a lot of my inaction is not spiritual at all. It’s the simple, primitive avoidance of discomfort. Not even big discomfort. Small discomfort: the awkwardness of asking, the pain of being a beginner, the irritation of paperwork, the embarrassment of being seen wanting something.

My pride is pathetic. It’s a cheap pride, the kind that comes free with failure: “At least I’m not desperate.”

But I am desperate. I’m just performing nonchalance because it feels less humiliating than hope.

# A small experiment with the Tao, conducted in a Kolkata winter

This morning I did something radical. I did one thing.

Not a grand thing. Not a life-revolution thing. One thing that took less than ten minutes and required no moral transformation.

I washed a cup properly. Not the ceremonial rinse. The real one: soap, scrub, rinse, dry. I did it slowly, paying attention to the sensation of the sponge dragging across steel, the way water beads and then disappears, the tiny squeak that means clean.

This is so small it’s almost insulting to call it an “experiment,” but that’s kind of the point. If my life is stuck under static friction, I don’t need cosmic ambition; I need a tiny shove.

The Taoist move here is not to force a heroic reinvention. It’s to find the smallest action that fits the grain of the moment, the one that doesn’t trigger resistance, and to do it cleanly.

Effortless action, in my current condition, looks like lowering the bar until my nervous system stops panicking and agrees to participate.

I hate that this works. It feels undignified. My ego wants a dramatic narrative. My ego wants me to be the kind of man who changes his life in a montage.

But real change is usually just a dull accumulation of small, unromantic repetitions. It’s closer to erosion than to explosion.

So the cup gets washed. The balcony still exists. The phone still contains a thousand ways to avoid living. The city still smells like burnt leaves and old arguments.

But there’s a tiny pocket of order now, a clean surface where yesterday there was sticky residue. My brain registers, however faintly: *action can change a local reality.*

That is not enlightenment. That is not salvation. That is just evidence.

And evidence, unlike ideology, actually helps.

# A parting image that refuses to be a moral

By late morning the fog thins, the sun arrives with the mild reluctance of a government clerk, and the street below becomes louder, as if someone turned up the volume on human existence. I watch a boy—school uniform, too-big backpack—hop over a pothole with the casual athleticism of someone who hasn’t yet learned to expect disappointment. His shoes slap the road, he doesn’t look down, he doesn’t narrate his suffering, he just moves.

I envy him in the ugliest way, then immediately feel ashamed for envying a child because my mind is a petty, complicated animal.

Inside, on my table, there’s a book I’ve been meaning to read properly, the kind with underlines waiting like teeth. Next to it, my phone glows with fresh outrage and fresh distractions. Two gods, both hungry.

I don’t pick a grand philosophy. I pick a small action.

I put the phone face down—like turning a loud person toward the wall—and open the book. The page smells faintly of paper and dust and whatever optimism the publisher had when they thought readers still had attention spans.

Outside, the dog scratches again, solemnly, like an old monk with fleas.

I read a paragraph. Then another. Not because the universe demanded it, not because history will reward it, not because I have finally become a better man, but because for a few minutes, at least, I’m doing something that doesn’t feel like force and does n’t feel like surrender either—just a quiet alignment with the fact that I’m alive, I’m here, and the day will pass whether I move or not.

The balcony rail stays cold.

I stay, for once, less still.
