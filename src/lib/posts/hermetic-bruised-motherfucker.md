It always begins with an itch—not poetic or mystical or metaphorical—the actual crusted, eczema-flecked swamp-patch in the back fold of my left knee, sweating under the faded elastic of my cheapest pair of boxer shorts, the ones I reserve for Mondays, for penance, for that unnecessary masochistic devotion to self-disgust that I’ve cultivated like some monk of the Order of the Perpetual Rectal Rash. The skin there itches, seeps, oozes a fine sap, and I, with the absentminded conviction of a priest lighting incense, scratch, sniff, wince, and scratch again, and this is precisely how most of my human interactions begin too: with irritation, wetness, shame, and eventually, an open wound.

And I used to try, I swear to whatever god is currently trending on WhatsApp pujo threads, I did. I tried fucking talking to people—real ones, not AI chatbots or deranged YouTubers selling hydrogen peroxide enemas as brain-enhancing supplements—but the more I tried, the more I realized I was attempting to converse with the bipedal equivalent of colon polyps sprouting opinions. They speak with the unshakeable conviction of a teacup that believes it's the fucking ocean.

The problem isn't just that they’re wrong.

It’s that they’re wrong *with confidence*, and that’s the part that boils my metaphorical piss and literal tea water.

Like that beady-eyed neighbor of mine—who looks like an overcooked mushroom stuffed into khaki bermudas—lecturing me, without provocation, on how the COVID vaccine causes erectile dysfunction because he read it on "a very credible blog by a homeopath in Guwahati." This from a man who hasn't seen his dick without the help of a mirror and a ceiling fan since the UPA era.

This isn’t ignorance, this is chemical warfare.



So I retreat.

Not for some noble, monk-like minimalist enlightenment bullshit, no, no—I retreat because human contact is a kind of biohazard. Not metaphorically, *literally.* A psychological fomite. The way touching a doorknob at a public toilet in Shyambazar guarantees you three forms of dysentery you didn’t know existed. My mind—already a cyclonic bipolar fuckpile of misfiring neurotransmitters, pharmaceutical bribes, and cortisol-soaked mattress farts—simply *cannot* deal with the gaslighting conviction of half-educated WhatsApp scholars whose scientific references include Baba Ramdev and a guy they once met near a goat.

Conversation becomes trench warfare. Their arguments are like feces-laced arrows—they fly fast, stink instantly, and leave infection long after you think you’ve recovered. The small bruises from these encounters don’t fade, they *fester* in my skull. A 10-minute chat about the lunar calendar can trigger a five-day neurochemical nosedive that ends with me Googling whether drinking expired Dettol is “technically fatal or just unpleasant.”

No, motherfucker.

I retreat because that’s *less* dangerous than pretending we live in a common reality anymore.

We don’t.

We exist in parallel fart clouds of belief.

Their reality is a post-truth kaleidoscope where turmeric cures cancer, Adani is misunderstood, and climate change is a Western conspiracy designed to humiliate the Indian diesel SUV owner. And me? I’m stuck here, trying to explain the thermodynamic principles of entropy to people who think the Second Law of Thermodynamics is a Pakistani plot.



You think I exaggerate? Allow me a small detour through the sewers of my recent memory.

There was this charming shitstain at a tea stall who, upon hearing me mention photosynthesis, decided to "correct" me: "No no dada, plants don’t *make* oxygen, they take it. Just like us. Trees *breathe in* the carbon *and also* oxygen. They're greedy."

I stood there, stunned, holding my glass of overboiled sugary tannin piss, thinking, “This is why I stopped going outside.”

My therapist—a woman who I suspect thinks Freud is a type of German yoghurt—told me I need to “reconnect with society.” Bitch, society *needs* a firmware update.

I can’t be expected to keep interfacing with a civilization that genuinely believes cow piss can purify groundwater but somehow simultaneously thinks modern sanitation is a Western perversion.

It’s like trying to debug a machine built entirely from wet cardboard, superstition, and cousin marriage.



And let’s not even get started on the spiritual *wankosphere*—the ones who believe chakras can be realigned by screaming into a copper bowl during a full moon.

I met one of them once—a cousin of a cousin’s cocksucker husband—who earnestly explained to me that depression is caused by "toxins trapped in the perineum."

I asked if that’s why I fart so much.

He didn’t laugh.

These people *don’t* laugh.

They just *know.*

With the conviction of a feral dog guarding a half-eaten samosa.



So yes, I am a hermit.

I boil my tea water in an old mute pan with a bent handle, the way some people boil heroin in hotel bathrooms—carefully, with reverence, and full awareness of the addiction.

I cook one-person meals with surgical precision, like I’m autopsying the last vegetable in the fridge. I eat alone, shit alone, mutter science facts to myself like a cracked-up museum docent, and avoid contact with my fellow homo sapiens as if they are radioactive but smellier.

I don’t *dislike* people. I simply find them... incompatible with existence.

I am a wounded modem, jacked into a network of farting fax machines spewing memes instead of information.



Once, during a particularly manic episode, I attempted to host a dinner for three ex-colleagues.

I spent four days prepping a decent lentil stew and printed articles on cognitive biases for post-dinner discussion.

They spent the entire evening talking about Elon Musk’s brain chip curing paralysis *and* poverty.

I now use the guest mugs to store my nail clippings.



Sometimes I get lonely. Sure.

But even that feels like a cleaner pain than the bruises of interaction.

Loneliness is a controlled lab experiment. Talking to people is like throwing your mental health into a thresher and hoping the shredded bits reassemble into something resembling a conversation.

You think I’m exaggerating?

Try explaining the placebo effect to a man who believes that coriander water increases sperm count because his WhatsApp group “felt more vigorous” after drinking it.

*

In the end, I exist like a scratched CD in a world that’s all USB-C ports.

Unreadable. Obsolete. Spinning in futile loops while the devices of the world politely ignore my format.

Which is fine. Honestly.

Because every time I step out and try to “reconnect,” I come back with one more dent in my frontal cortex and one less reason to keep pretending it’s worth the price of admission.

Now if you’ll excuse me, I think I just saw a WhatsApp forward on my building gate about how swallowing copper coins resets your DNA.

And I need to go shit.
