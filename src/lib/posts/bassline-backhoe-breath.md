The first thing you notice isn’t the sound, it’s the vibration—an invisible hand shaking the marrow of the building—followed by that particular Calcutta perfume of diesel breath and pulverized stone, as if someone is grinding a centuries-old courthouse into chutney right outside my door, and then the sound arrives properly, late to its own party, a hard metallic clank and the impatient stutter of a machine that does not understand the concept of “enough already.”

They dug this road up before the pujas, made a big show of smoothing it, rolled it flat, gave it a ceremonial pat on the head, and now—because nothing here is allowed to remain finished for more than the lifespan of a mango—they’ve reopened it, peeled it back like a scab, exposed the tender underlayer of incompetence, and placed the broken asphalt in heaps that resemble black cake left out in the sun, the kind of cake you serve only to enemies or to committees.

And because the universe enjoys layering its irritants like a sadistic pastry chef, somewhere nearby a celebration has switched on its speakers, and the bass is marching through my closed doors and windows as if low frequency has diplomatic immunity; I can’t even record it properly on my phone because the microphone obediently listens to mid and high frequencies—polite citizens—and largely ignores the subterranean thump that travels through walls, bones, and teeth, the way a rumor travels through a family without ever appearing in writing. The physics is straightforward and therefore insulting: long wavelengths wrap around obstacles, they don’t need a line of sight, they don’t care about your expensive window seals; the body is an accidental antenna, and my skull, it turns out, is a decent resonator at someone else’s preferred tempo. *Congratulations*, I tell myself, *you’ve become a percussion instrument.*

I get headaches from bass, the kind that feel less like pain and more like being slowly edited—some invisible intern deleting your ability to think in full sentences—while the backhoe conducts a parallel seminar in air pollution, tossing particulate matter into the lane as if the atmosphere is an infinite bin. I’ve watched neighborhood cats pause mid-prowl, mouths slightly open, that faint panicky gulp that says the air is no longer a background, it’s a negotiation; watching an animal struggle to breathe is a moral argument delivered without words, which is convenient, because words are dangerous here when you refuse to perform the usual gestures of reverence.

People say “noise” as if it’s just sound with bad manners, but noise is a physical force and also a political one—noise is what you produce when you don’t have to care who is hearing it. There’s a small, bleak insight hiding inside that sentence: the loudest people are often the ones least forced to imagine other minds, which is why my fantasies sometimes get petty and anatomical. I catch myself wishing I could become one of those blessedly uncomplicated creatures—overconfident, incurious, impervious to evidence—because ignorance is not merely a lack, it’s an insulation, a thermal blanket for the brain, and I am cold with awareness. Then I remember I’ve read too many books, and there’s no unreading, no voluntary lobotomy package on offer, no “return to factory settings” for a life that has tasted clarity.

And then there are the podgy female shrill studio anchors—studio hippos in psychedelic fluorescent jackets, bobbing in climate-controlled tanks of light—bellowing made-up “breaking” nonsense with the practiced fury of people paid by the syllable, as if shouting were verification and urgency were evidence; the graphics strobe, the tickers crawl, the producers feed them outrage pellets, and they inflate every rumor into a national emergency because silence would reveal the emptiness, because in this economy decibels are treated as content and confidence as truth, and I can hear the same garbage news playing in neighbors’ houses in accidental stereo and some cursed 8D surround—one TV a fraction of a second behind another, voices phasing like a cheap echo effect—because winter air carries sound better, the colder, denser atmosphere acting like a faithful transmission medium, a bitch that doesn’t discriminate between Bach and propaganda, between a lullaby and a lie.

When I was young in old North Calcutta, the lane had its own rough logic, its own limits; the street vendors knew where to stand, the rickshaw bells had a rhythm, the neighborhood, the *para*, could be irritating and intimate in the same breath, and yes there was noise then too, but it had gaps, pauses, pockets of accidental quiet. Now the city behaves like a badly maintained sound system: every knob is stuck at maximum, the equalizer is set by a drunk, and the person holding the remote is convinced loudness is the same thing as joy. The celebration music isn’t even music anymore, not in the human sense; it’s a low-frequency occupancy claim, a sonic flag planted into the air—this is ours, this hour is ours, your skull is ours too, don’t pretend you have boundaries.

I try to think about the engineering, because engineering at least has the decency to be falsifiable. Why does the phone miss the bass? Because tiny microphones are designed with high-pass filtering to reduce handling noise and wind rumble; because dynamic range is finite; because designers assume you want speech intelligibility, not the seismic autobiography of your neighborhood DJ. Why does bass penetrate? Because the wavelength at, say, 50 Hz is several meters long, and your window is not a fortress, it’s a suggestion. Why does this all feel like a personal attack? Because the brain is a pattern machine, and it hates randomness; it keeps trying to assign intention to what is merely structural failure.

And then the backhoe yanks me out of acoustics and into civics, because the road is being “fixed” again, which in India can mean anything from legitimate maintenance to a tender being “utilized” to keep a chain of petty patronage fed, and the trouble is that both look identical from the balcony: dust, noise, a man in a reflective vest pretending to supervise reality. We have built a society where the visible work is often theater, and the invisible work—planning, inspection, accountability—is a rumor told only in brochures.

There’s a colonial ghost in this too, as there is in almost everything we touch here, including the very idea of a “proper road.” The city’s arteries were widened and straightened for commerce and control, for moving goods and troops, for making bodies legible to administration; the British loved a line you could draw with a ruler, and we inherited the fetish for visible order without inheriting the ethics that might sustain it. Postcolonial pride then arrives like a belligerent cousin at a wedding—loud, easily offended, ready to interpret criticism as treason—and suddenly a complaint about particulate matter becomes an insult to the nation, as if the nation is a fragile god who must be protected from data.

Speaking of gods: there’s a special local superstition that if you slap enough mythology onto a problem, it becomes sacred and therefore exempt from improvement. Air is bad? Must be karma. Roads collapse? Must be fate. People suffer? Must be a test. This is not spirituality; it’s intellectual tax evasion. The old patriarchal trick—wrap the mess in metaphysics, then scold anyone who asks for a receipt. I’m allergic to it, and allergies, inconveniently, involve breathing. At some point, as the bass continues thumping like a lazy heartbeat and the road continues being amputated in sections, my mind wanders into etymology, because that’s what it does when it’s cornered: it tries to build little museum displays inside the skull, as if labeling a thing makes it survivable.

I admit, I’ve been cheated by my own romanticism too. I came back to India with that NRI sheen still on my eyes—the belief that if you bring skills and sincerity, the world will meet you halfway—and the country greeted me like a street magician: smile, patter, flourish, now your wallet is gone and you’re somehow applauding. The damage isn’t only financial; it’s neurological, a slow erosion of trust until even simple interactions feel like hostile negotiations. Somewhere in there I learned a cowardly wisdom: tell the truth too directly and you invite consequences; bluntness is treated as aggression, rationality as arrogance, and the demand for evidence as an insult to someone’s ancestral pride. So I’ve become careful in the ugliest way—careful not because I respect others, but because I don’t trust them.

And then there’s my mother, which is where the essay stops being an essay and becomes a daily manual. I don’t have the luxury of grand ambitions anymore; the remaining ambition is mechanical: keep a set of lungs working, keep oxygen moving in and out, keep infections away, keep panic from becoming physiology, because she is enfeebled by that inexorable label of time we call age, and she needs the financial support to still exist — and if she doesn't I have nothing else to look forward to. This is the part people don’t put in patriotic speeches—the part where “family values” are not slogans but unpaid respiratory labor. I had bought her and myself an RO purifier last year, which is its own small satire: clean water as a consumer upgrade, like a streaming subscription, while the city outside treats air as an ashtray. The RO sits there, humming softly, a tiny private infrastructure, the domestic equivalent of building your own moon because the sky has been outsourced to incompetence. Just recently many people died in Indore, it happened somewhere else, elsewhere is a license to be cavalier in India, so I hide our insignificant lives behind a RO.

Sometimes I wonder if this is what modern citizenship is: you pay for your own micro-safety while the macro-system rots, and then you’re told you’re ungrateful for noticing. The post-leftist in me is tired of slogans; the rationalist in me is tired of magical thinking; the *bhadralok* in me—God help me—still wants to believe that education should produce a gentler society rather than a better-armed one. But education here is often ornamental, a certificate nailed to the wall like a dead butterfly, while the real social currency is volume: volume of voice, volume of faith, volume of certainty, volume of music. The subwoofer becomes a political model.

There’s a philosophy-of-mind angle hiding in the bass too, because of course there is. The brain is a prediction engine; it tries to reduce surprise by modeling the world. In a stable environment, prediction becomes wisdom. In an unstable one, prediction becomes anxiety. You can’t settle into thought when the sensory stream is constant assault—noise spikes, dust, honks, sudden shouting, the backhoe’s metal teeth—so your mind becomes reactive, twitchy, short-horizon, and then the same society that shattered your attention mocks you for lacking calm. We create a landscape that punishes cognition, then reward the people best adapted to cognitive shortcuts, then pretend it’s virtue.

So yes, I sometimes fantasize about becoming stupider—not morally worse, just simpler, buffered, less permeable. It would be efficient. But the problem with knowing how things work is that you start seeing the joinery everywhere: the way low-frequency sound bypasses your walls, the way PM2.5 bypasses your cilia, the way corruption bypasses accountability, the way mythology bypasses causality, the way nationalism bypasses shame. Knowledge is a flashlight you can’t switch off, and once it’s on, you see the dust dancing in the beam.

Around dusk the construction slows for a moment—never stops, just pauses like a predator licking its lips—and I take that pause as if it were a gift from a reluctant universe. I rinse a glass from the RO, hold it up, watch the water catch the light; it looks clean in that narrow sense, transparent and obedient, and it’s absurd that such a small clarity feels like a victory. Outside, the bass continues, indifferent, and a thin film of gray settles on the window ledge again, as if the day has been gently powdered with ash.

I wipe the ledge with a damp cloth, once, slowly, not because it matters, not because the cloth will defeat a city, but because my hands need to do something that has a beginning and an end.

The cloth comes away dark, and the speakers thump on, and that’s the whole thesis.
