I wake before the fan has finished one of its weary revolutions, already aware—through the thin, damp cotton of the sheet—of that particular sweat which is not the product of heat but of memory itself, as though the past, having found no other outlet, had chosen the skin as its medium of return. 

The room, still half-submerged in night, smells faintly of soap, old fabric, and the indefinable residue of days that have been lived too similarly, and in that smell, inseparable from the present moment yet belonging to no single time, there rises the figure of my mother—not as she is now, seated somewhere far away beneath another ceiling fan, but as a persistent principle, a living archive in whom my earlier selves continue to exist with a coherence that I myself no longer possess.

# The Architecture of Cowardice 

It is perhaps this knowledge—that she remembers me intact—that makes her at once indispensable and unbearable. For when I think of her, I do not think merely of a person but of an entire apartment, with its mosaic floor chilled in winter mornings, its light filtered through curtains browned by decades of Calcutta dust, its cupboards preserving the odors of camphor, paper, and meals long digested. 

To visit her would be to submit myself to that space where memory is not speculative but architectural, where the walls themselves seem to insist that I once occupied them with purpose, movement, and an expectation of continuity. And so I visit my old apartment in North Calcutta infrequently as the walls that prop me up are vulnerable to collapse in conversations—I fear it will come out I am made out of thin air, so I choose distance from all that was once familiar, friend or family, not from indifference, but from a kind of self-preservation that resembles cowardice only because it lacks a nobler name.

Lying there, listening to the fan’s uneven rhythm—slightly off-balance, as though one blade had accumulated more history than the others—I become acutely conscious of how reduced my inner life has grown, how many dimensions have quietly collapsed without ceremony. Once, thought branched outward, seeking objects, problems, explanations; now it circles, like air in a closed room, conserving energy rather than spending it. 

The sciences I once trusted for their clarity return to me only as metaphors: damping without oscillation, systems settling into low-energy states, equilibrium mistaken for rest. I recognize these ideas not intellectually but bodily, in the heaviness of my limbs, in the reluctance of breath to complete itself with confidence.

# Treacherous Sparks

At moments—treacherous moments—I feel a sudden quickening, a sensation like the striking of a match in darkness, and for an instant the world appears once more connected, actionable, almost hospitable. I think, absurdly, that I am better than this, that I might yet re-enter life as one steps back into a conversation left unfinished. 

But even as the thought forms, I sense its fragility, its dependence on borrowed oxygen, and before it can reach the dignity of a full sentence, it extinguishes itself, leaving behind only the faint odor of disappointment. What remains is not despair exactly, but an alert resignation, the knowledge that such sparks, though vivid, are not durable enough to be trusted.

Language itself seems complicit in this erosion. Words like “depression,” learned first as abstractions, now press down with a literal weight; terms like “withdrawal” describe not a gesture but a habitat. I live, increasingly, as one who has stepped aside from the main current of time, not in protest but in fatigue, inhabiting a private margin where days resemble one another too closely to require naming. I tell myself this is clarity, that illusions have simply been stripped away, yet I know there is a cruelty in such lucidity, a narrowing of possibility disguised as wisdom.

# Morning

When morning finally intrudes—grey, tentative, without promise—I sit up and observe the room as though it belonged to someone else: the books that have ceased to instruct and now merely witness, the glass of water left untouched overnight, the pale wall where a gecko remains perfectly still, ancient and indifferent, surviving by a mastery of stillness I can only imitate. 

Somewhere, my mother's nurse will be making tea for my mother, repeating gestures perfected over habit and instructions, and my mother will be sipping that tea, believing—perhaps correctly—that continuity itself is a form of care. I do not move toward her, nor away. I remain where I am, suspended in the present, which is neither painful nor consoling, but simply there, like the fan above me, turning, imperfectly, again.
