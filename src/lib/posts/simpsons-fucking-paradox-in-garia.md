My stomach made that sound again.

You know the one I mean—like a whale getting punched in the gut underwater by a slightly confused but well-meaning kraken. Followed by a low, accusatory *glorp* that echoes through your asshole like a municipal drainpipe regurgitating tea shop leftovers. I was squatting in my miniature bathroom—the one where the plastic water bucket and the commode have a toxic relationship—and I was calculating whether I had time to run the geyser before the next splashdown, but alas, South Calcutta had already decided. The inverter had conked out. And this bastard part of the city, once a proud dumping ground of post-liberalisation optimism and broken concrete socialist dreams, now sat squelching under its own armpit sweat, too far from everything, too close to itself.

Now, here's the thing: I’m not dumb.

I know what paradox means. I know what averages do. I once scored 100 in math. I know that your average fuck doesn’t mean every thrust was worthwhile. But *Simpson’s Paradox* is a cocksucker. Not the charming kind that buys you tea and rubs your shoulder while you confess your soft dick never quite recovered from 2008. No. This is the one that says you’re improving—in every subgroup—yet still somehow you’re getting fucked harder in the total. It’s the statistical equivalent of Calcutta real estate logic: every flat is selling better than last year, every block says sales are rising, but the whole goddamn sector has collapsed like my left testicle in winter.

I live in a neighbourhood where time bends backwards.

Not in a sexy Nolan way with violins and reversed explosions, but in a saggy, existentially constipated loop. The grocery shop has had the same fly inside the jar of *chanachur* since Diwali. The postman delivers letters from the 90s. The plumber wears pants so tight the very crack of dawn peeks out when he bends. Nothing dies here. Even the pigeons look depressed but immortal. You can walk for forty-five minutes and see only two things: temples being repainted in blood-red and teenage boys playing cricket in drainage water like they’re training for a mutant IPL team.

So when I try to explain Simpson’s Paradox to someone—say, the gas delivery boy with suspiciously well-groomed armpits—I use this neighbourhood.

See, I say, imagine two apartment buildings. Both are showing more electricity uptime than last year. Their maintenance costs are lower. Less rats, more lights. Great. But when you add their data together for the whole area, *total* uptime is lower than last year. Why? Because the bigger building got a lot worse and had more tenants. It weighs the average down, like my fucking beer belly weighs down my dreams of ever buttoning a shirt without sweating. Everything looks better inside, but shittier outside.

That’s South Calcutta.

Every house has a small victory—a new LED bulb, a child not addicted to PUBG, a grandmother who only mildly praises Hitler—but the neighbourhood as a whole is disintegrating into a fungal nostalgia pit of sewage, tuition fees, and delayed marriages. That’s Simpson’s Paradox with bidi smoke. The illusion of progress depends on how you slice the groups. Grouped one way, you're surviving. Grouped another, you're face down in pisswater pretending it’s therapy.

And speaking of slicing groups—I sometimes wish I could statistically segment my life.

Take the two me’s. The one who reads PDF copies of philosophical essays about urine symbolism in Beckett, and the one who scratches his balls on the balcony at 2:17 a.m. thinking about whether any of his exes ever masturbated to the memory of his left nipple. Both those me’s are improving. One has grown intellectually. The other now knows which bakery uses expired flour. But aggregate me? Oh, that motherfucker is falling apart. Lying to himself with clean Excel sheets while jerking off to Instagram reels of people making sandwiches with cleavage.

My local doctor, the guy who still uses a mercury sphygmomanometer like it’s 1962 and radio is king, told me I was showing signs of “urban deflation.”

Not depression. Deflation. Like my soul was an old tire on Gariahat flyover, slowly leaking air but still pretending it could go another mile if the traffic cop wasn’t looking. He told me to walk in the mornings. I tried. But walking in Garia is a full-contact sport. You either dodge a feral scooter, a vegetable seller’s scream, or a retired uncle whose farts have gravitational pull. And the moment your brain tries to meditate, your asshole remembers you had milk tea with roadside muri last night and decides to initiate Operation Mudslide.

Let’s talk about that tea.

Tea here is made by people who hate existence but love overboiling. There’s this little corner shop—paint peeling off like postmenopausal dandruff—that serves tea in plastic cups so thin they melt before you’re done. One sip and you know three things: you will fart, you will regret, and you will come back. Because even regret is routine in this city. Even bad decisions become part of your gut biome. And this—this—is where Simpson’s Paradox becomes a gastrointestinal metaphor: each cup is better than the last, but your body still collapses into acidic rebellion.

I miss the kind of statistical clarity we had as children.

Did you poop? Yes or no. Was the fish tasty? Yes or no. Did that boy touch your dick behind the library? Yes or no. But adulthood is averages, and averages are lies. Like when my mother tells people I’m doing "well" now. What she means is I’m not in jail, not dead, and not married. That's the holy trinity of mediocrity here. By subgroup? Sure, I’m thriving. I’ve got books, lube, a rice cooker, and mild porn-induced wrist strain. But in aggregate? I'm a declining trendline no amount of data smoothing can save.

Sometimes I think this whole area is one giant statistical error margin.

The milk is always “almost” fresh. The plumber is “nearly” coming. The metro is “about” to be completed. And every woman I’ve ever liked is “not entirely” unavailable. You can’t even properly fail here. You just asymptote toward irrelevance like a limp dick in a cold bathroom trying to reach an orgasm that’s already archived.

People ask me why I don’t move.

I tell them: I am the moving. I am the entropy. If I leave, the rats will miss me, the pigeons will unionize, and the local paan-stained walls will forget how to listen. I am statistically insignificant, but topologically trapped. And besides, where would I go? North Calcutta hates me for leaving. South Calcutta laughs while fingering its bellybutton and offering me another glass of lukewarm boredom. And Salt Lake? Fuck Salt Lake. It’s like a failed Dubai cosplay run by retired engineers who think they invented water.

The paradox isn’t just in the stats. It’s in the body.

My knees hurt less than last year. My blood pressure’s better. I drink more water. But I also cry in the kitchen while microwaving dal for one. I cum less. Dream less. My mother no longer knocks on the door to ask if I’m okay. She just assumes I’m alive because the electricity bill still arrives.

And that, I suppose, is how life works here.

Statistically improving. Experientially rotting. 

Just like my underarms, which now smell like detergent-covered despair and hint of onions from a lunch I didn’t even eat.

Today, I tried to jerk off while watching an ASMR video of a woman whispering math facts. 

I stopped halfway—not from guilt, but because she said “confidence intervals” and I remembered I had to pay my internet bill.

Then my phone buzzed with a Swiggy notification for discounted *rajma chawal*.

And I came anyway.
