Very prettily and whence I fart when tense,

See me in the center—hangs a schlong.

This, my dear, a Bengali feature lovely,

Called tongue—is talkative and very long.

February is the month of change,

In Sonagachhi, syphilis and gonorrhea bloom.

Valentines and wilting dicks on the stage,

With festivities, bootleg, ganjika and shroom.

The Hindloo and Mostlame gods fight,

All months of the year on Godi media heads.

The government chucklefucks cheer prudely on—

Surely insanity in a holy land needs many beds.

It's so true, I tell you—Shiva’s testicles blue,

From his high lair, AQI is unbreathable chewy air.

Fartsy yogic chants, reunited venal underhands—

I see in my shit stains the Kalyugic despair.

Flabbergasted, hand shit crusted always Parvati,

Was found fisting asshole for cowdung in hill cows.

She had to cook for her many manly abdomens,

It was a shitty pigsty her hillbilly silly house.
