There’s a special kind of betrayal that comes when your own ass doesn’t warn you. No sputter, no burble, no polite intestinal murmur like “Hey buddy, incoming.” Just—*pffffft*—a full-volume protest note from your asshole, unsigned, and you’re suddenly sitting in a dense mustardy fog, eyes watering, questioning every decision that led you to this point, which in my case was *eating fucking radish during Makar Sankranti*.  

For the uninitiated, Makar Sankranti is one of those Indian harvest festivals that pretends it’s all about the Sun entering Capricorn and realigning your chakras or some such astrological cockbuttery, but it’s actually an excuse to make sweet things with jaggery, burn leftover furniture, and dump every cheap root vegetable into your already suffering gut in the name of "ritual purity." You eat sesame. You eat flattened rice. You eat sweets wrapped in sugar lies. And you fucking eat radish.  

Not ordinary radish. No, this is *festival radish*. Celebratory mulo. Radish that’s been sung to by your delusional neighbors. Radish that’s been offered to gods and then immediately offered to your colon as a sacrifice. It's juicier, angrier, plucked fresh from some forgotten edge-of-city plot where the soil is 40% pesticide and 60% ancestral trauma. And during Sankranti, the damn thing gets upgraded. It's suddenly sacred. It's in the air. In the parathas. In the fritters. In your mother’s forced joy and your own reluctant compliance.  

And me? I went all in. I chopped it, fried it, stuffed it inside my parathas like some middle-aged fart genie trying to prove something to the ghosts of all the relatives who still believe this is a “cleansing” festival. Well, it *cleansed* me all right. By 4 PM my stomach was making sounds like two snakes fucking in a plastic bucket.  

I don’t know what it is about Makar fucking Sankranti that makes the radish think it can walk into your digestive system with its chest out, demanding special treatment. But it does. My insides become a war room. The enzymes panic. Bacteria go into rage orgy mode. And out comes *The Gas*.  

This isn’t normal farting. This is *revenge gas*. A dense, sulfur-rich atmospheric act of terrorism that emerges unprovoked—like a bad tweet at a funeral—and it doesn’t linger so much as *occupy*. My room is 10x12 feet and by god, after two rounds of radish paratha, it became Chernobyl with bedsheets.  

I let out one particularly resonant beast while reaching for the power strip and actually lost balance. It was a structural fart. Like it changed the gravity in the room.  

And this wasn’t a solo affair. Because it’s Sankranti, I had visitors. Those sugar-soaked fucknuggets who think it’s okay to drop by uninvited because "today is auspicious"—yes, *auspicious for what*, exactly? My own butt declared chemical war and I had no Geneva Convention to fall back on.  

My boxers smelled like expired dreams.  

One poor bastard walked in bearing til laddoos and left coughing like he’d walked through a burning chemical plant. Another one, a shrill pious relative with paan breath and an opinion on everything, asked me if I’d been using mosquito coils. I looked her straight in the face and said, “Yes, but for the *inside* of my body.”  

It didn’t even stop at farts. No. Makar Sankranti radish attacks in *waves*. You think you’re done, then you stand up too quickly and *whoosh*, your lower intestine squeezes out another sonic event. I farted so loudly into my own chair cushion that it trapped the sound and played it back three seconds later like a haunted Alexa.  

I tried walking it off. Bad move. Every step released a puff. It was like playing the world’s worst bagpipe, one that only plays the sound of public shame and air freshener defeat. I could feel my soul trying to leave my body through the same exit.  

And of course, because it’s Sankranti, people were flying kites and praying and posting sunrise selfies while my room became a containment zone. The neighbors sprayed incense. A kid outside yelled “kachra!”—I don’t know if he meant the kite or the smell coming from my window. I took it personally.  

There’s something cosmically cruel about a day meant to celebrate the sun—renewal, cleansing, whatever Hindu Instagram says—being turned into an unholy gut furnace by a vegetable that smells like foot sweat and burps like a demon.  

No yoga, no meditation, no amount of sun salutation can save you from the internal reality of a radish-detonated colon.  

The human gut, let’s be honest, is not built for reverence. It is a hot, wet, wrinkled doubt machine. On Sankranti, it becomes a courtroom, a place of reckoning. My stomach had opinions. My intestines had *demands*. And my asshole, that final uncorked exit of all my suppressed rage and gassy regrets, declared open rebellion.  

By nightfall, I was lying on my mattress, bloated like a washed-up walrus, one hand on my belly, the other waving away the residual gasclouds, wondering how the fuck my life had come to this. Alone. Mid-festival. Loosely dressed. Deeply ashamed. And still… farting.  

I farted into a steel plate by mistake while collecting the sweets. It echoed. Like a temple bell rung by Satan himself.
