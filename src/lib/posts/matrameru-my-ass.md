It started with a fart.
One of those high-pitched, suspiciously eloquent ones that sounds like it’s quoting Latin and accusing you of crimes at the same time—philosophical fart, not just a random butt burp but a prelude, a warning, a fucking Sanskrit overture. Laghu. Guru. Laghu. Prrrrt. Splat. Matrameru, motherfucker. The Mountain of Cadence, rising right out of my ass.

You ever try to time your dump so the water splash doesn’t slap your balls with last night’s regret? I do. I conduct my shits like a Vedic orchestra, every grunt a stanza, every turd a metrical unit, every hemorrhoid a tortured vowel.

Because that’s where it lives now—ancient India, that glorious past everyone loves to finger-fuck for their morning nationalism chub, discovered the Fibonacci sequence while trying to sing a poem without spitting phlegm on the priest. Pingala. Virahanka. Hemachandra. Real fuckers with real tongues who sat there counting combinations of long and short syllables—Laghu and Guru like a goddamn Morse code for monks with prostate issues. And while some Italian dick named Fibonacci was still figuring out how to grow rabbits without fucking his cousin, these motherfuckers were metering entire universes into chants.

You know what's recursive? My despair. My thoughts loop back like an infinite turd that just won’t sever, every time I try to find a fresh start it circles back to the same clotted memory—a failed erection in 1997, the smell of burnt rice on an electric coil in Behala, my father’s silence like a repeating decimal.

And speaking of patterns—oh, sweet baby fuck of math—don’t even get me started on prosody. You think rhyme is sexy? You think rhythm is just a thing rappers do while grabbing their dick? Try being an undersexed Bengali man reading Pingala at 3 a.m. with an itchy asshole and a dying ceiling fan, realizing that all of life is just alternating syllables between slap and silence. Between the Guru of never-coming and the Laghu of premature hope.

Because here’s the truth, bitch: history is not a line, it’s a chant. It loops. It hiccups. It repeats with minor shits and major delusions. And if you think the current crop of chai-sellers-turned-saviors are inventing anything new, suck my Fibonacci spiral. We’ve been in this recursive nationalist diarrhea since before zero was a sparkle in Brahmagupta’s eye.

You want a metric pattern? Here’s one:
Hope. Disillusionment. Rage. Repeat.
Hope. Disillusionment. Rage.
Repeat.

Hemachandra sat there, probably scratching his nuts through muslin, realizing that the number of possible meters wasn’t magic—it was structure, hidden and looping and kind of beautiful in a way that makes you want to punch yourself for being so lonely while thinking it. Because that’s the fucking rub. The moment I feel awe, my brain coughs up a hairball of shame.

Even my orgasms are recursive.
Always the same rhythm—click, scroll, click, scroll, guilt, click, despair, squirt.

And I teach myself the Mātrāmeru with a dry pen and unpaid broadband.
I chant Fibonacci backward like a demon.
13, 8, 5, 3, 2, 1, 1, 0.
Zero. The Indian invention. My fucking life.

The sequence doesn’t lie.
You don’t just get 21 out of nowhere.
You add up your last two shits.
That’s all you are.
A recurrence of regret.

Colonial cocksuckers came and shaved the names off the original syllable-counters, rewrote the scripts, painted the brown saints white, gave themselves all the syllables—long, imperial Guru ones—and left us with the Laghu stutter of post-independence hard-ons.

But let’s be honest.
It wasn’t just the white bastards.
We fucked it up too.
We fed Pingala’s recursive gold to the godmen and the CBSE textbook mafia, to WhatsApp aunties who now think Fibonacci was a Gujarati from Vadodara and the golden ratio is proof that Krishna invented Instagram filters.

I tried to write a poem last week.
Got to line three and had to shit.
Had to count the flush cycles.
Two for semi-solids. Three for the fibrous long fellows.
Mātrāmeru.

My toilet tank is a metrical pattern,
and the flush button is Virahanka’s wet dream.

Science is no savior.
It’s a mirror.
And I am ugly in every possible rhythm.

My back hurts,
my nipples itch,
and I have used the Fibonacci sequence to count how many days it’s been since I last felt useful.

13.

Yesterday I sneezed and farted at the same time.
I call it a Pingala Event.

My bowels chant in laghu-guru beats while I microwave rice in a cracked Chinese bowl that hums in fucking golden ratio intervals.

There’s no redemption here.
Just echoes.
Just shit loops.

Just the slow math of dying.
