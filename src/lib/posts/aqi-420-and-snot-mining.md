I woke up choking on something that felt less like a natural biological byproduct and more like a shard of unpolished pottery, lodged firmly behind the uvula. The uvula, in case you’re not up on your bodily trivia, is that frantic little punching bag at the back of your throat designed specifically by some ancient prankster god to bob like a nervous pigeon every time you gag, cough, or try to look dignified during a medical exam.

Anyway.

It’s not that I mind the occasional nasal excavation. No. I take a certain craftsman’s pride in my efficiency—years of practice in classrooms, metro stations, and mild existential crises have trained these crooked Bengali fingers into skilled archaeologists of the sinus cavity. But lately, my harvests have been... evolving.

They glitter.

Not metaphorically, not with the sheen of vitality, no, I mean literally glinting—specks and dust and something worryingly granular in the mix, as if my own skull has been repurposed as an open-pit mine. Neodymium in my nose. Lanthanum in my left lung. Cerium in my cough.

And I read—because I’m a masochist with Wi-Fi and a morbid curiosity—that India is proposing to normalize AQI 420.

As in, four-hundred-and-twenty.

A number previously reserved for college dormitories and giggling teenagers is now the particulate count at which your bronchial tubes begin holding tiny protest rallies. The kind of air quality that makes a campfire seem like a spa treatment. And they’re not warning about it. They’re calling it normal. Standard. A new benchmark. Like it’s the Maruti 800 of respiratory conditions. Like your child's persistent wheeze is just a new way of saying "I love my country."

420. Just the number of your slow, clinical pickling in bureaucratic decimal points.

Now here’s where it gets truly bizarre.

While we’re pretending this smoke isn’t smoke, the powers-that-be are floating a plan to collect *mucus*—yes, the humble residue of a billion sneezing citizens—and extract from it *rare earth minerals*.

You heard me.

We’ve gone from simple recycling to what I can only call *respiratory mining* as a GDP strategy.

The handkerchief is now a state resource.

It’s not enough that our rivers are questionable and our soil is exhausted; no, we must now exhale value. We are human filters for the nation's mineral ambitions.

Your lungs: an air scrubber.
Your nose: a collection tray.
Your cold: a strategic reserve.

You want to be part of the green transition? Here, breathe in this metallic dust, develop a formidable sinus condition, and then kindly deposit the results into a government-issued receptacle for processing.

It’s beautiful, in a horrifying sort of way. It’s capitalism with a runny nose.

I grew up in a house where we wiped our noses on sleeves and hoped nobody noticed. Where a blocked nostril meant you just weren’t trying hard enough. Where no one said "air pollution" because the word didn’t fit in the vocabulary of men who rode rusty bicycles to desks and believed in Vicks VapoRub the way some people believe in miracles.

And now, decades later, I stand here—well, sit actually, one foot on a broken plastic stool, inhaling the spicy air through a leaky window, trying to cook rice in a blue Chinese rice cooker that sparks menacingly when I cough—and I think: this is it. This is my contribution to the future. Coughing up dysprosium like a Dickensian orphan with a side-hustle in commodities trading.

I swear, if Marie Curie had been born in Calcutta, she wouldn’t have worried about radium; she’d have been too busy trying to filter three decades of dust and bureaucratic sighs out of her curtains.

But digressions help.

Let me tell you about rare earths. Not rare, and not particularly earthy. Seventeen nuisances in the periodic table’s awkward corner—scandium, yttrium, lanthanides—used in every gadget you love: your phone, your earbuds, your fancy hybrid car that still smells like new plastic and moral superiority. Extracting them is a nightmare, but now, somehow, someone has figured out that human biology captures trace elements. Possibly from breathing all this delightful AQI-420 soup.

You think I’m kidding?

I once had a sinus X-ray that looked like a geological survey. The doctor showed me the printout and said, "Your sinuses are congested," and I asked, "With what? The motherlode of thorium?" He didn’t laugh. He looked concerned.

There’s very little comedy left in a situation where the air makes you richer if it doesn’t tire you out first.

And yet I’m still here. Still wiping strange, sparkly dust from my nose, pretending to work on some hopeless tech startup with no office and no funding—just a logo, a dream, and lungs full of monetizable matter.

I am, quite literally, a national asset.

My sneeze is worth more than my savings account.

If I go tomorrow, they’ll sweep up the tissues from my bedside table and sell them to a processing plant for isotope extraction.

You want to understand the Indian middle class? We are hardy, prematurely grey, degree-bearing mines, coughing in small apartments, watching our own breath fog up the windows while the news anchor shouts about the stock market.

We don’t just breathe.

We metabolize.

And we dream of clean air the way some people dream of winning a sweepstakes they never entered: nostalgically, pathetically, and with the full knowledge it’ll probably never happen.

Today, my head aches in that specific, heavy way that only highly textured air can deliver.

I blow my nose, watch the tissue sparkle faintly in the sunlight—maybe it's titanium dioxide, maybe it's just the remnants of a difficult morning—and I think, perhaps I should send this to a laboratory with a note: "Kindly use before expiry. Source: Right Nostril. Grade: Upper-middle-class, low hope."

I’d write more, but my left eye is watering from the sting of the atmosphere, the rice is burning again, and I’m out of tissues. And the worst part? They won’t even give me a royalty check.
