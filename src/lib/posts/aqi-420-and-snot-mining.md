I woke up choking on a yellow booger so sharp it could’ve been a baby katana, lodged like a fucking ceramic dagger somewhere behind the uvula, which, in case you're not up on your bodily trivia, is that obscene little punching bag at the back of your throat designed specifically by some ancient god of humiliation to bob like a drunk pigeon every time you gag, dry-heave, or try to look dignified during a Covid swab.

Anyway.

It’s not that I mind the occasional nasal excavation. No. I take perverse pride in my nose-mining efficiency—years of practice in classrooms, metro stations, and existential crises has trained these crooked Bengali fingers into skilled archaeologists of hardened snot formations, entire civilizations of mucus that would make paleobotanists come in their khakis. But lately, my harvests have been... evolving.

They glitter.

Not metaphorically, not with the sheen of shame or dignity-losing adulthood, no, I mean literally glinting—flakes and dust and something worryingly granular in the corner crusts, like my own skull’s been repurposed as an open-cast rare earth mine. Neodymium in my nose. Lanthanum in my left lung. Cerium in my fucking cough.

And I read—because I’m an idiot with Wi-Fi and no gag reflex for bad news—that India is proposing to normalize AQI 420.

As in, four-fucking-twenty.

As in, the particulate count at which your bronchial tubes begin reenacting *Bhagat Singh’s* last breath. The kind of air quality that makes nicotine seem like a spa treatment. And they’re not warning about it. They’re calling it normal. Standard. A new fucking benchmark. Like it’s the Maruti 800 of respiratory conditions. Like your child's persistent wheeze is a patriotic act.

420. Not even metaphorically weed-related anymore. Just the number of your slow clinical asphyxiation in bureaucratic decimal points.

Now here’s where it gets truly rectal.

While we’re pretending this smoke isn’t smoke, this pain isn’t pain, the ministry of What-the-Fuck-Even-is-Science is floating a plan to collect *mucus*, yes, *snot*, *bogeys*, *phlegmatic ejaculate from the wheezing nose holes of a billion and half poisoned fucks*—and extract from it *rare earth minerals*.

You heard me.

We’ve gone from cow piss as antiseptic to motherfucking *loogie mining* as GDP strategy.

Snot is now state resource.

It’s not enough that our rivers are shit-filled, our soil full of hexavalent chrome, and our leaders full of holy cow diarrhea masquerading as climate policy—no—we must now *excrete value*, *inhale minerals*, *hack up profit margins*. We are now human filters for the state’s mineral ambitions.

Your lungs: an air scrubber.
Your nose: a sluice gate.
Your snot: a strategic reserve.

You want to be part of the green transition? Here, breathe in this metallic fuckdust from a Chinese-funded open pit in Odisha, develop stage-three sinusitis, then blow your nose into a government-issued tissue that goes straight to Hindustan Rare Earths Ltd. for triage and monetization.

It’s beautiful. It’s revolting. It’s capitalism with a deviated septum.

I grew up in a house where we wiped our noses on sleeves and shame. Where boys were told to shut up and breathe through it. Where a blocked nostril meant you *deserved* it for not bathing properly. Where no one said "air pollution" because the word didn’t fit in the wage-slaved vocabulary of men who rode rusty cycles to shitty desk jobs and believed in Vicks like it was Jesus.

And now, decades later, I stand here—well, sit actually, boxers bunched in the crack of my itchy ass, one foot on a broken plastic stool, inhaling spicy death through a leaky window, trying to cook fucking rice in a blue Chinese rice cooker that sparks when I cough—and I think: this is it. This is my contribution to the future. Coughing up dysprosium like a Dickensian whore with asthma and a side-hustle in ESG tokens.

I swear to all the rectal gods of science, if Marie Curie had been born in Calcutta, she’d have died not of radiation but from three decades of dust, diesel, and bureaucratic farts wrapped in tricolor.

But digressions help.

Let me tell you about rare earths. Not rare, and not particularly earthy. Seventeen bastards in the periodic table’s creepy uncle section—scandium, yttrium, lanthanides—used in every fucking modern gadget you love: your phone, your earbuds, your fancy hybrid car with eco-mode that still smells like Elon’s cologne and the crushed bones of Congolese children. Extracting them is a pain in the arse—literally radioactive slurry and solvent-soaked nightmares—but now, somehow, some underpaid MIT dropout in Noida has figured out that human mucus carries trace elements. Possibly from breathing all this delightful AQI-420 cocksmog.

You think I’m kidding?

I once had a sinus X-ray that looked like a mineral deposit survey. The doctor showed me the printout and said “Your sinuses are congested,” and I asked, “With what, the motherlode of thorium?” He didn’t laugh. He looked scared.

There’s no comedy left in this absurd country where air makes you richer if it doesn’t kill you first.

And yet I’m still here. Still wiping neon-yellow sludge from my nose, tasting iron in the back of my throat, pretending to work on some hopeless carbon nanotech startup with no office, no funding, no hope—just a logo, a dead dream, and lungs full of monetizable mucosal matter.

I am, quite literally, a national asset.

My sputum is worth more than my savings.

If I die tomorrow, they’ll sweep up the blood-flecked napkins from beside my bed and sell them to a PSU for isotope extraction.

You want to understand the Indian middle-class? We are snot-hardened, prematurely grey, degree-bearing mucus mines coughing in 2BHKs, watching our own breath condense on mosquito-netted windows while the news anchor screams about stock indices and temple inaugurations.

We don’t breathe.

We metabolize particulate matter.

And we dream of clean air the way some people dream of anal with an old edition playboy pinup: nostalgically, pathetically, and with the full knowledge it’ll never happen.

Today, my head aches in that specific cavity-pounding way that only PM2.5-infused snot can deliver.

I blow my nose, watch the tissue sparkle faintly in the sunlight—maybe it's titanium dioxide, maybe it's unicorn dandruff, who knows—and I think, maybe I should send this to CSIR with a note: “Kindly use before expiry. Source: Right Nostril. Grade: Upper-middle-class, low hope.”

I’d write more, but my left eye is tearing up from the peppery sting of breathing, and the rice is burning again, and I’m out of tissues, and the bastards won’t even give me a fucking royalty.
