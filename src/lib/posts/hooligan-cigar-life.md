The air out here tastes like the inside of an old man's foreskin that’s been marinated in cough syrup, pesticide, and burnt tire.

And every fucking morning, I wake up coughing like an asthmatic goat with gonorrhea, scratching my balls through fraying boxers while some underpaid municipal fuckstick drills holes into the already cancerous sidewalk, because that’s what the suburbs are—a war crime disguised as planned development. You hear people romanticize villages, cities, mountains, rivers—but not this. No one sings songs about sweating out your dignity in a two-room matchbox beside a plastic-choked drain that occasionally belches like it’s trying to puke up Calcutta’s shame. No, this isn’t a place. This is a cigar. A thick, unfiltered, hairy-dicked hooligan cigar permanently lodged in your mouth by life itself, and no, you don’t get to spit.

You smoke.

You inhale.

And you age like a boiled corpse in formalin.

There is no exhale.

My neighbor—a man who looks like a collapsed lung in a wife-beater—actually lights a real fucking cigar every evening like he's Churchill reincarnated with dysentery, which I suppose he is, minus the bulldog jaw and war crimes. He puffs and waddles and farts simultaneously. Like a one-man climate disaster, a living counterargument to Darwin, entropy with a mortgage. Every time he farts, a butterfly dies. Probably of shame. I envy him. At least he doesn’t pretend.

The rest of us do. That’s the fucking disease.

We pretend the smoke isn’t real, the stink isn’t real, that the air won’t cause your sperm to commit sudoku and your ovaries to sprout tumors the size of angry lychees. We wear masks. Not for COVID. Not anymore. No, now it’s just another accessory, like the bastardization of English or the way we pretend chai is artisanal when it tastes like ass filtered through cardamom.

Because in a city, and worse, the bastard boondocks flapping off the side of a dying city like a half-detached hemorrhoid, you don’t live.

You *smoke* existence.

Every breath is a puff of slow, dumb resignation, rolled tight with layers of failed public policy, wet-dreamed middle-class aspirations, and the lingering foreskin-sweat of colonialism. And underneath all that? Nicotine. Or its metaphorical cousin—dopamine trickled down from doomscrolling and binge-junking and fighting with ghosts on Twitter about which dead tyrant had a better GDP. 

And when the cigar burns low?

You suck harder.

Because that's all that's left.

Even my shits have started smelling like burnt paper and pan masala. I wake up constipated and go to sleep with diarrhea. My intestines, it seems, can't decide whether they want to hoard the past or purge the present. That, I think, is the most honest reflection of this place. The body as a confused, broken bureaucracy—always filing the wrong forms, shitting at the wrong time, farting in meetings with imaginary women I will never fuck because I've aged into irrelevance, like a password-protected zip file from 2006.

And of course I still get hard-ons.

Randomly.

Shamelessly.

While washing dishes. While staring at pigeons. While watching a two-decade-old rerun of *Discovery of India* where Nehru stares out of a prison cell like he knows you’ll end up jacking off to his prose one day out of sheer loneliness and guilt. You can’t even jerk off properly anymore, not without triggering your bipolarity like it’s some cock-shaped Pavlovian bell. Come = crash. 

So I delay it.

The orgasm. The escape. I delay everything. Even breathing sometimes. I ration my hope like an old lung cancer patient who still chews Airwaves because the burn reminds him of life.

You ever seen someone smoke with such determination that their lips blister but they *won’t fucking quit*? That’s me with hope.

I drag it in even though it burns.

Because the alternative is silence. Which, in Calcutta, is never really silence. It’s just the sound of someone else’s dying, politely muffled by concrete and diesel.

The air isn’t air. It’s ash. Memory burnt and re-breathed. I remember clean air like I remember orgasms without guilt. Barely. Like a dream that ended mid-sentence.

Sometimes I catch myself breathing wrong on purpose, like maybe if I swallow the right kind of toxin, my body will finally collapse *correctly*, like a tent that was always meant to fold in on itself with tragic grace.

But no.

I remain.

I linger like a fart in a prayer room. Unwelcome, persistent, vaguely theological in my uselessness.

And the worst part? The real fuck-you from life? I *still* try.

I trim my nose hairs. I floss. I swipe right on apps where nobody replies. I drink ginger tea for inflammation even though my soul is the only part of me still on fire. I wipe my ass thoroughly.

Which is to say: I participate in society.

Which is to say: I smoke the cigar of existence and pretend the flavor isn’t dried cum and broken dreams rolled in cow shit and bureaucratic failure.

Which is to say: I live.

Until the tip burns my lips.

And even then, I might just light another.

Because fuck it.

Maybe this one will finally kill me.
