The taste of iron is still there when I burp, which I do involuntarily now, a kind of body-fuck tic like I’m half-geyser, half-gas chamber, courtesy of some ulcer maybe or just the slow rot of my hippocampus that smells like molten pennies and drying piss under a hostel bed where someone jerked off in 1997 and forgot the tissue under the mattress for ten years.

I remember this smell. It’s the smell of stress. Of being in class ten with sweat pooling in my ass crack while someone’s singing the fucking “Ekla Cholo Re” in the next room because it’s Rabindrajayanti and I’m supposed to be a good Bengali boy but instead I’m just a twitchy cunt of a human calculator, scared to forget the Laplace transform of e^(-3t)u(t) while my bowels tremble from nervous chai. That’s what meritocracy feels like. An unlubed colonoscopy from the ghost of Macaulay.  

My mother said truth mattered. My father, who had enough dogma in his moustache to run a small Stalinist republic, insisted that honesty was the final frontier. So I swallowed that turd whole and decided to be a good boy, didn’t cheat, didn’t butter, didn’t tug the dicks of my professors metaphorically or otherwise, and now look at me. Gaped. Like a flowerpot fucked by a tandoori skewer.  

They don’t tell you this when they talk about “doing well” and “being the best.” They leave out that the best gets you nowhere when you’re a skinny Bengali boy with peeling lips, a 20-rupee gel pen, and an anxiety disorder that curls around your amygdala like a garter snake sniffing for failure.  

I read Sapolsky. That beardy American cocksucker with the zebra ulcers. He said stress fucks the hippocampus. Makes it shrink. Makes memory leak like a tap in a shitty government bathroom where the plumber is probably dead. I nodded so hard reading that book I gave myself whiplash.  

It *is* rotting. I forget words now. Words like… “purpose.” Or “fuckable.” Or “plan.”  

It started in second-year engineering. One day I was solving Fourier Series like a nerdy gangbanger with a calculator fetish, and the next I was staring at the ceiling fan wondering how hard I’d have to jump for the neck crack to be instant and not just mildly paralyzing. Bipolar, they said later. Depression. Genetic? Situational? Who gives a goat’s hairy fuck.  

It *felt* like betrayal. Like the same truth and hard work they applauded in the Civics textbooks had snuck behind me in the shower and jabbed a broken thermodynamics textbook into my prostate.

The funny thing is, India doesn’t give a rat’s herniated cunt about truth. It’s a giant gameshow run by uncles who smell like sandalwood fart and expired patriarchy. Truth is something you watch others dodge while you stand there with your pants down, waiting for the moral high ground to form under your fungal feet.  

They all moved up. The bootlickers, the smugglers of personality, the loudmouth grinners who knew which chai to spill and when. I stayed behind, like a broken calculator no one wanted because it didn’t suck cock or play cricket.  

This country rewards artifice like it’s a fucking god. You wear it like a second foreskin—oily, smug, uncut, eternal. You bullshit your way through meetings, code reviews, relationships, marriages, temple bells, PhDs, and when someone like me walks in trying to solve something for real, they ask if I have a LinkedIn Premium subscription.  

Meanwhile, in America, the same Kakistocratic dick buffet is happening with more expensive lawyers and better-looking news anchors. Trump’s out, in, out again—like a bad prostate massage from a senile dominatrix in a MAGA thong.  

And here I am. Forty-nine, broke, mad, still jacking off to the memory of a girl who once handed me a stapler in 2002. My blog gets 11 views. Ten of them are bots trying to sell me hair transplant pills and one is me, drunk.  

There’s something cruelly funny about the fact that being honest shrinks your hippocampus. Like biology itself is telling you: “Don’t be a dumbass. Learn to lie.” The cortisol eats your neurons like termites with Ivy League degrees.  

Maybe the stress lives in my bowels now. I fart when I bend. I shit when I sneeze. I have the dignity of a collapsing lung.  

Some days I try to write. But the words come out like phlegm. Thick, bitter, and hard to swallow. I see people post on Medium about growth, resilience, leadership. I want to reply with a picture of my feet, cracked and fungal, with the caption: “This is your brain on truth.”  

If you don’t suck ass, you’re canceled. Not on Twitter, no—I’m not even visible enough to be hated. Just canceled like a bad cheque written by a middle-class boy who thought he could change something by being “good.”  

And don’t get me started on spirituality. These days, every chaiwallah is a guru, every Instagram slut is an energy healer, and every limp-fuck rich bastard thinks colonics and kombucha are a path to moksha.  

I once tried a breathing technique from a YouTube video. Ended up shitting myself in a power cut. That’s enlightenment for you.  

I’ve seen enough. Meritocracy is a rotted tooth in the asshole of history. It never existed. Not in school. Not in jobs. Not in love. Not in anything that involves more than one human and a decision.  

If you want to survive, grow a second tongue. One for licking boots and the other for licking assholes slightly above you in the pecking order.  

I didn’t. I believed in the story. Like a cunt.  

Now the only things I fuck are time, memory, and my own expectations.  

I don’t even get erections properly anymore.  

They rise, unsure, like a shy protester at a fascist rally, half-hearted, then collapse when the room gets too cold or the gas bill arrives.
