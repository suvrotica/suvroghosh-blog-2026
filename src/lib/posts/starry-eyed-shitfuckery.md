There was once this cockfaced municipal candidate, khadi-shirted, Gandhi-topi tilted like an erection after an accidental thigh brush, sweat rings under his armpits shaped like the map of Greater Bengal if you squinted and held in a fart, standing on a broken dais in front of a borrowed mic (which smelled like fermented curry spit and rusted dreams), pointing up to the sky with the same hand he had absolutely scratched his ass with, proclaiming: **"Vote for me, and I will give you that star."**

Yes. That actual flaming fuckball in the sky. That thermonuclear bindi of false hope.

The crowd clapped. Some farted. One motherfucker fainted from spiritual excitement or dehydration or both. One old constipated skeleton in a gamchha cried actual tears, either because of blind devotion or because he thought the promise involved free adult diapers. No one laughed. Not a single bastard laughed. They believed it.

Not metaphorically. Literally. They *actually* thought—if they voted for this moustache-sporting maniac with onion breath and a violent twitch—that somehow, by some celestial reacharound, the motherfucker would lasso that flaming nuclear tit in the sky and hang it from a lamppost in Howrah like a Durga Puja chandelier.

And here’s the really dangerous thing: they *wanted* to believe it. Needed to. Like how you need to believe that the fucking woman on Tinder with a pout and filter and “sapiosexual” in her bio is not a bored BTech dropout trying to scam you out of 800 rupees and your semen.

Because the truth is: life here is so fucking humiliating, so chronically bowel-gnawing, so filled with piss-streaked government stairwells and diesel coughs and erections of pointless bureaucracy—*that you’d rather believe the lie.*

You’d rather die clutching a fake star in your hand than live staring at a real pothole in your lane that nobody has fixed since Indira Gandhi’s left tit started sagging.

And this isn’t just one time. No, motherfucker, this is every five years. Like seasonal herpes. The lies get recycled like temple prasad. Same shit, different turban.

"I will build a bridge to Pakistan."

"I will make India a 5 trillion dollar economy."

"I will give free electricity, free petrol, free pussy, free Wi-Fi, free rainbows, free immortality."

All shouted with veins popping, arms flailing, moustaches flapping like dying rats in a blender. Behind them, always—*always*—a fucking banner with one sad, flickering, five-pointed yellow star. Like some cosmic sticker of approval granted by the Universe’s dumbest intern.

But the bastards *eat it up*.

This entire country is like a man who keeps going back to the same STD clinic and every time the doctor tells him, “Stop fucking goats,” he says “This time it’ll be different. I wore a condom made of banana leaf.” And then scratches his burning urethra while humming the national anthem.

Hope is the most overrated drug.

Even heroin has the dignity of withdrawal.

Hope just makes you stupid *on loop*.

And it’s not just the poor. Oh no, don’t you dare think it’s just the rice-packet voters and chapati-hungry schoolchildren waving tricolor flags outside the ration shop. No. The educated are worse. More insidious. They read policy PDFs. They quote GDP forecasts. They masturbate to "infrastructure growth" charts. But the second some slick-haired prick in a kurta says, “We will touch the stars together,” they start weeping like they just heard Lata Mangeshkar sing through a seashell.

It’s like this whole country is stuck in a *collective religious orgasm*, 24x7, where logic goes to die like a flatulent goat in a temple fire.

And speaking of goats: why the fuck do we elect the same bleating shitbags over and over? Same families. Same slogans. Same ritualistic touching of the air in front of statues like they’re giving invisible handjobs to ghosts of failed freedom fighters.

Because it’s not about governance. No, you prick. It’s *theatre*.

India is not a democracy. It’s a 1.4 billion–strong improv play where every actor shits their pants and still gets a standing ovation because “at least he’s not that other guy.”

The only thing more dangerous than a lying politician is a population that gets a hard-on from the lie.

And I know this because I’ve seen it happen since I was five years old.

Same slogans. Same bastard promises.

They promised my father a job.

They promised my mother clean water.

They promised me internet and dignity and at least one fucking moment of truth in public life that didn’t make me want to rip my own nipples off and mail them to Rashtrapati Bhavan.

Instead?

Brown tap water. Broken job market. And an internet so full of cockroach-brained influencers that I feel like strangling myself with my LAN cable every morning.

The last time someone promised to "give me a star", they were a party worker with halitosis handing out stickers that had glitter glue on them and made my shirt smell like fevicol and sad childhood.

You know what that star is?

It’s constipation.

That’s what it is. It’s a tight, throbbing, unreachable thing lodged so far up the national rectum, we’ve mistaken the pain for destiny.

We point to it.

We elect it.

We worship it.

We name our babies after it.

And we never, ever fucking ask why it keeps disappearing the moment the rally ends and the lights go off and the diesel generator dies with a cough that sounds suspiciously like a resigned “fuck you.”

And I?

I sit here in my dim rented room in this dying Calcutta para, surrounded by mosquitoes that vote more wisely than humans, my feet crusted with old skin flakes, watching my broken rice cooker bubble like a fart in a bathtub, and I try—*really try*—to imagine what it must feel like to believe again.

To be part of that idiot choir that looks at a man pointing to a celestial gas ball and thinks “Yes. He loves me.”

But all I can think about is the last time I trusted someone, I ended up with my dick in one hand and a ration card in the other, wondering which one would be more useful when the world burns.
