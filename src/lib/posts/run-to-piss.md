I run to piss, I've started to hiss,

I feel the dancing droplets drip.

The gods do know, to make 'em flow,

All I do is run a really long trip.

---

By Kali, Bengali & Indians ALL fuck-twats,

Selfish garam-masala rabid dicks and cunts.

I hence always run, and run really fast,

Or I'll be sandwich in their meat hunts.

---

Yessiree, I run, like a bullet from a gun,

The wind blowing my balding hair.

I can feel a full fruity fart forming,

I knew heaven was always goodly fair.

---

These drops will drown, small insects brown,

But that's alright I might as well sing.

It's really a matter of hindoo morals I feel,

Not stopping to eat any trampled thing.

---

My balls and belly, maybe on telly,

A naked Bengali pissing on the run.

Who knew I could get so famous so fast,

An ass unfun, ass-fucked by the sun.

---

In my fifty so now fartsy but not shifty,

I only wank to imaginary numbers on indices.

Stumped deep in thought that's all I got,

I run the maze of mother fucking matrices.

---

Suvro my name, Ghosh a shitty surname,

But they say I have shit faced the race.

My relations very weak, feeble I squeek,

May the drunken devil lube my rim case.

---

And so I run, son of a bitch cunt gun,

My face bright with what I think I might.

Full fart ahead, I run until I'm dead,

For possibilities however slim or slight.

---

Yes they are rare, mostly deadly snare,

Pits with snakes hissing bollywood.

So I don't ever stop everything's a flop,

Smelly farts I leave whenever I should.

---

Shit fuck lame FUCK the only national game,

Indians fuck each other day and night.

The national creed to stay stupid, be

More corrupt & religious than upright.

---

So I will run and run give up in the sun,

That last piss will run out of my ass.

That'll be a good day when I thus die,

The holy dingo dance on my dead carcass.
