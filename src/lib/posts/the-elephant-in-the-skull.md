    caption="A map of India pretending to be an elephant, carrying history and a personality disorder."

The drawing is a map of India pretending to be a patient suffering from severe elephantiasis, which is already a very Indian sort of metaphor—cartography as disease, nationalism as pet animal—except this man is not majestic. He’s lumpy in his balls where it hurts the most, semi-bored, vaguely constipated, like he has been asked to carry history on its back and has responded by developing a personality disorder.

I drew him with the kind of impatient tenderness you reserve for your own worst habits. Not hatred, not pride—more like that exhausted, familiar disgust you feel when you catch yourself doing the same idiotic thing again, the brain reaching automatically for the same cheap comfort, the same inflated narrative, the same little lie that keeps you warm but makes you stupid. My hand did the outline first, that confident stroke that always arrives before the confidence is deserved, and then I had to go back and dirty it up—stippling, shading, giving him that swollen, lived-in misery—because even caricature needs biology. Even satire needs flesh.

And there’s something deliciously obscene about using a medical condition as a national allegory, because India is the sort of place where metaphors are always bodily if you look long enough. We don’t just have corruption; we have rot. We don’t just have inequality; we have infestation. We don’t just have ideology; we have fever dreams. We speak in stomach and skin and blood and purity and pollution, even when we pretend we’re talking about GDP.

Also I’m fifty-ish, stuck in the south Calcutta boondocks with a mind that behaves like a miswired electrical panel—sparks of hypomanic pattern-making, long brownouts of depressive realism—so my metaphors tend to arrive wearing sandals and dragging a bag of groceries: ordinary, physical, faintly pathetic.

# A Quick Science Detour, Because I Can’t Resist

Elephantiasis—real elephantiasis—isn’t a moral failing. It’s a physiological tragedy. Lymphatic filariasis, parasites, mosquitoes, a quiet war happening under skin; a drainage system clogged until the body swells grotesquely, not because the body is arrogant, but because the plumbing is broken. The lymph system is one of those unglamorous miracles: it hauls away waste, moves immune cells, keeps tissues from becoming soggy ruined sponges. When it fails, the body doesn’t politely malfunction. It balloons. It announces the failure.

That’s why it’s such a cruelly perfect metaphor for societies.

Because societies also have drainage systems. Not literal ones—though India, famously, struggles with those too—but conceptual ones: institutions that remove waste ideas, that filter nonsense, that prevent the same toxic myths from recirculating until they become culture. The scientific method is one. Journalism, at its best, is another. Courts, when they’re not asleep. Education, when it teaches thinking rather than obedience. A functioning civil service. A social norm that says: *you don’t get to claim anything you like just because you said it loudly*.

When those systems clog—when superstition becomes identity, when propaganda becomes patriotism, when caste becomes “heritage,” when religion becomes a political weapon—the social body swells. Not with strength. With edema. With trapped fluid.

And then the swelling itself becomes proof. Look how big we are, the swollen nation says. Look how powerful. Look how ancient. Look how *special*.

A tumor also grows. That doesn’t mean it’s winning.

# Why I Drew His Balls First

It’s vulgar, sure, but it’s honest. The groin is where insecurity lives. Not poetry-insecurity—actual, sweaty, trembling insecurity. The place where evolution stored the fear of being laughed at by the tribe, rejected, made irrelevant. We dress it up as honor, pride, tradition, culture; underneath, it’s the same mammalian panic: *am I safe, am I respected, am I desired, am I allowed to exist without being crushed*.

India’s public mood often feels like a man constantly protecting his crotch while shouting about greatness.

And I’m not outside this. God knows I’m not. The part of me that wants India to be “great” is not the part that cares about justice or science or dignity; it’s the part that wants my own life to retroactively matter, my own disappointments to be reframed as merely temporary setbacks in the grand civilizational arc. If the tribe is glorious, then my smallness feels less humiliating. If the nation is special, then my mediocrity becomes a rounding error.

This is the psychological engine of supremacy narratives everywhere—national, religious, racial, whatever. The ego is a hungry little bureaucrat. It wants a stamp. It wants certification. It wants a letterhead that says: IMPORTANT PERSON, BELONGS TO IMPORTANT GROUP.

So I drew the swelling where it hurts most, because that’s where the lie lives.

# Inflated Self-Esteem: The Inflatable Raft of the Poor

The cartoon labels it like a symptom: inflated self-esteem, overconfidence, shallow knowledge. People might read that and think it’s pure insult—Indians are arrogant and dumb, ha ha. That’s the cheap reading. The satisfying reading. The reading that lets you feel smarter than a billion people without doing any work.

But when I wrote “inflated self-esteem,” I wasn’t thinking of strength. I was thinking of an inflatable raft.

You don’t inflate a raft because you’re proud. You inflate it because you’re drowning.

A lot of India’s chest-thumping is not confidence; it’s compensation for humiliation—colonial humiliation, poverty humiliation, the daily humiliation of being treated like a replaceable insect by systems that don’t have to care. And when a society has been humiliated for a long time, it develops a weird reflex: it starts building myths the way a body builds scar tissue.

Some scars are protective. Some scars make you stiff.

The trouble is that scar tissue doesn’t feel like weakness. It feels like armor. And armor, once you’re wearing it, starts making you behave like a soldier even when you’re just buying potatoes.

# Overconfidence: The National Sport Nobody Admits They Play

Overconfidence is not just a personality trait. It’s a social reward structure.

In India, certainty is applause-worthy. Nuance is suspicious. Doubt is treated like treason or softness or—my favorite accusation—“confusion,” as if being confused in a complex world is a personal failure rather than an accurate perception.

So people learn to speak like gods even when they know like toddlers.

I’ve watched men who can’t explain how interest rates work explain geopolitics with the confidence of a CIA director. I’ve watched family WhatsApp groups transform a badly edited video into a worldview in ten minutes. I’ve watched religion become a substitute for curiosity: why learn when you can chant?

And yes, of course, this happens everywhere. Humans are credulous animals with smartphones. But India adds particular accelerants: a brittle status hierarchy, a schooling system that often trains memory more than reasoning, and a political culture that thrives on spectacle. Overconfidence becomes not just common but *functional*. It gets you jobs. It gets you followers. It gets you power.

Meanwhile the quiet person who says “I don’t know” gets treated like a malfunction.

This is why I’m suspicious of any society that treats humility as weakness. Humility is not self-hatred. Humility is epistemic hygiene. It’s washing your hands before you touch reality.

# Shallow Knowledge: The Coaching-Class Epistemology

Shallow knowledge is not “knowing little.” It’s knowing things that haven’t been metabolized—facts as ornaments, concepts as trophies, vocabulary as camouflage.

India is brilliant at producing the appearance of knowledge. We are the homeland of the exam guide, the shortcut, the “important questions,” the last-minute crash course, the coaching-industrial complex that treats learning like a military drill: memorize, reproduce, rank, repeat.

The tragedy is that this system can produce high scorers who are intellectually malnourished.

It can also produce the worst kind of semi-educated arrogance: the man who has just enough jargon to bully other people, and just enough ignorance to never suspect he’s wrong. The Dunning–Kruger creature—though I hate invoking that phrase because it has become another shallow meme, another way to dunk on others while pretending to do psychology.

But the phenomenon is real. The less you know, the easier it is to feel certain.

Knowledge, actual knowledge, comes with discomfort. The more you learn, the more you see the edges of what you don’t know. The world grows teeth.

So shallow knowledge is seductive because it gives you the warm feeling of understanding without the cold price of humility.

# Caste and Religion: The Old Plumbing That Keeps Clogging Everything

I drew “caste” and “religion” near the lower body not because I’m trying to be edgy, but because these systems are deeply bodily in India. They are obsessed with touch, with food, with purity, with contamination, with who can be near whom, who can marry whom, who can enter which space, who can do which work. They are social biology pretending to be spiritual order.

Caste is not merely prejudice. It is infrastructure. It is networks, marriage markets, informal references, the invisible hand that is not a hand but a very old fist.

Religion, in its everyday politicized form, becomes a technology for organizing crowds—identity, belonging, moral permission, enemy-making. It can also be beauty and community, yes, but I’m allergic to the grandstanding version, the version that talks like God hired a PR agency.

The cartoon doesn’t say “religion = bad.” It says religion becomes a chronic disease when it is used to justify supremacist fantasies and to keep people from asking questions that would threaten the hierarchy.

This is where the elephantiasis metaphor bites again: when the drainage system fails, waste accumulates. And social waste is not only corruption money; it’s dead ideas that refuse to die. It’s myths that keep reproducing because they flatter the ego and stabilize power.

# The Worst Part: I’m in the Drawing Too

Here’s the part I hate admitting, because it spoils the righteous pleasure of satire.

I drew this cartoon, and then I caught myself feeling superior to the people I was criticizing, and that—right there—is the disease doing push-ups in my own head.

My depression tells me I’m irrelevant. My hypomania tells me I’m a prophet. Both are forms of narcissism, just dressed differently: one says, “I am uniquely doomed,” the other says, “I am uniquely insightful.” Either way, I’m the main character in a cosmic drama that reality didn’t agree to produce.

And because I’m bookish, my arrogance often wears a sweater vest. It quotes history. It name-drops science. It pretends that reading is a moral virtue. I can become the kind of man who thinks that because he has *language*, he has *wisdom*, which is like thinking that owning a map makes you a good traveler.

So when I label “inflated self-esteem” on the cartoon, I have to ask: whose self-esteem is inflated?

Mine, too.

When I label “shallow knowledge,” I have to stare at my own shelves—my half-read books, my hoarded PDFs, my concepts collected like stamps—and ask how much of it is actually lived understanding and how much is intellectual cosplay.

This is the humiliating thing about satire: it’s supposed to be a weapon, but it keeps turning into a mirror.

# Methods, Not Myths

If the cartoon is more than a cynical doodle, it has to point toward something other than contempt, because contempt is the laziest emotion—cheap, instant, endlessly recyclable, like plastic bags.

What it points toward, for me, is method. Not ideology. Not slogans. Methods.

The scientific method is one: you propose, you test, you try to falsify your own idea, you let evidence humiliate you, you update. Statistics is another: you quantify uncertainty, you resist the brain’s addiction to stories, you learn to live with probability instead of craving certainty. Philosophy—actual philosophy, not motivational posters—teaches you to define terms, examine assumptions, follow arguments until they either hold or collapse.

And it’s funny—darkly funny—that even the ancient Indian texts people weaponize as supremacy proof often contain warnings against certainty.

One of the Upanishads, in a line that feels like it was written specifically to ruin a WhatsApp forward, basically says: the person who thinks he knows doesn’t know. That’s not anti-knowledge. That’s anti-arrogance. That’s epistemic humility dressed as poetry.

Which is the opposite of how we use “tradition” today. We use it as a shield: don’t question, don’t examine, don’t test—just revere. But reverence without inquiry is how you end up worshipping your own ignorance, like a man polishing a locked box and calling it treasure.

# The Bitter Little Punchline

The elephantiasis patient in my cartoon is not India as a place—the smells of frying oil, wet dust, old books, the sudden sweetness of jasmine near a roadside shrine, the chaos that sometimes feels like a jazz solo and sometimes like a riot. I love the place even when I can’t stand the people, including myself.

The patient is India as an idea: swollen with stories it cannot metabolize, dragging around ancient hierarchies that keep rebranding themselves, mistaking noise for knowledge, mistaking pride for strength, mistaking supremacy for dignity.

And because I drew him, I have to admit something even more irritating: I drew him as a warning, but also as a confession. The cartoon is me trying to drain some of my own trapped fluid—my own resentment, my own disappointed love, my own itch to feel superior—onto paper, where it can at least be looked at under a harsh light.

Later, when the house is quiet and the ceiling fan does its tired helicopter impression, I’ll probably open a new document and start rewriting this, deleting sentences, adding clauses, trying to make the prose sound less like a man arguing with himself in the dark.

I’ll fail, of course. That’s part of the condition.

Then I’ll close the laptop, and somewhere in the corner of my mind that swollen cartoon-man will sit, lumpy and constipated and absurdly familiar, reminding me that the real chronic disease isn’t India.

It’s certainty.

And the only modest cure I know—the one I can practice even from my small, shabby corner of Calcutta—is the embarrassing habit of checking whether the story in my head is true before I start worshipping it.
