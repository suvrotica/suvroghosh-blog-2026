The paper is the color of old milk and bad decisions, a xerox that has lived too long, the way documents do in India—first as a useful thing, then as a sacred thing, then as a thing that cannot die even when you want it to. It’s curled at the corners like it’s trying to peel itself off reality. Somebody has stapled it to a noticeboard that already contains a missing-cow poster, a coaching class advertisement promising IIT to anyone with a pulse, and one of those laminated clinic schedules where “DOCTOR” is spelled like it lost a limb in battle.

The drawing is a map of India pretending to be an elephant, which is already a very Indian sort of metaphor—cartography as zoology, nationalism as pet animal—except this elephant is not majestic. It’s lumpy, semi-bored, vaguely constipated, like it has been asked to carry history on its back and has responded by developing a personality disorder.

Across its body are the “chronic diseases”: inflated self-esteem, overconfidence, shallow knowledge, caste, religion. The tail end of the page mutters something about “self perpetuating mythology” and “parochial supremacist views,” which is exactly the kind of phrase that appears when someone’s satire gets tired and decides to do a small amount of actual stabbing.

I stare at it for too long, because I’m the sort of man who will stare at a cartoon like it’s an MRI of a civilization, and because my brain—bipolar, book-fed, and perpetually underemployed—tends to treat any provocation as an invitation to build a cathedral out of toothpicks.

Also because the elephant looks familiar.

Not the India-elephant. Me-elephant.

The inflated self-esteem is right there, like a bloated organ in a medical diagram. I know this organ. I have carried it around in my chest like a secret contraband item: an absurd, tender certainty that I am special, that if the world had been fairer—or if I had been tougher, more disciplined, less allergic to authority, less moody—then some brighter timeline would have opened its doors and said, “Come in, sir, we’ve been waiting.”

This is a ridiculous thought, obviously. The universe is not a hotel.

But the thought persists, and it is one of those thoughts that feels like confidence until you touch it and realize it’s made of shame.

# The Elephant in the Skull

I like science because science is a polite way of saying, “Calm down, you primate.” It hands you a measuring tape. It gives you a graph. It points at your favorite belief and asks you to provide receipts.

And the first receipt we need, if we’re going to talk about “inflated self-esteem” and “overconfidence” and “shallow knowledge,” is that these are not uniquely Indian diseases. They are human diseases. *Homo sapiens* is basically a nervous system dragging a storybook around, trying to narrate the chaos into something flattering.

The brain is not a truth machine. It’s a survival machine that occasionally stumbles into truth the way a drunk man occasionally stumbles into the right bus.

We evolved to make quick judgments, to detect threats, to belong to groups, to punish traitors, to worship leaders, to find patterns in noise—because the cost of a false positive (thinking a bush is a tiger) was usually smaller than the cost of a false negative (thinking a tiger is a bush). So now we live in cities and scroll on phones and argue about cosmic metaphysics while our ancient pattern-detectors squirt adrenaline at memes.

This is why “overconfidence” is so common that psychologists don’t even need to hunt for it in exotic tribes; it’s the default weather of the mind. Most people think they are above-average drivers. Most people think they are unusually kind. Most people think their understanding of complex topics is deeper than it is. If this sounds like an insult, it’s not. It’s a design feature of a species that would rather be wrong and alive than correct and dead.

But then you place this human brain inside India, a country that is less a country than a crowded library where half the books are sacred, a quarter are propaganda, and the rest are exam guides; you pour in colonial history, poverty, humiliation, aspiration, caste anxiety, religious competition, and a modern attention economy that runs on outrage like a diesel generator runs on adulterated fuel, and you get… this elephant.

Not evil. Not stupid. Not uniquely cursed. Just a very specific flavor of human.

# A Small Detour Into Ancient Self-Help That Isn’t Self-Help

India loves ancient wisdom the way a drowning man loves driftwood. It doesn’t matter if the driftwood is actually a plank from a shipwreck that caused the drowning; it floats, so we cling.

And the ancient texts—Vedas, Upanishads, epics—are complicated things. They contain poetry, philosophy, ritual, metaphysics, politics, and the usual human mess: insight beside nonsense, tenderness beside hierarchy, skepticism beside certainty. They’re not one voice. They’re a crowded room across centuries.

Which is why I find it darkly hilarious that we use them as stickers. As slogans. As civilizational certificates.

Because if you actually open the Upanishads—those weird, sharp little philosophical knives—you keep finding lines that do the opposite of what our modern supremacy fantasies want. They don’t inflate you. They puncture you.

There’s a verse in the *Kena Upanishad* that I’ve always loved because it is basically a cosmic slap: *yasyāmataṁ tasya mataṁ mataṁ yasya na veda saḥ*—the one who thinks he doesn’t know, knows; the one who thinks he knows, doesn’t. ([upanishads.org.in](https://upanishads.org.in))

That’s not a nationalist anthem. That’s a warning label for the human ego.

And then there’s the famous old plea from the *Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upanishad*—*asato mā sad gamaya, tamaso mā jyotir gamaya, mṛtyor mā amṛtaṁ gamaya*—lead me from the unreal to the real, from darkness to light, from death to immortality. ([VivekaVani](https://vivekavani.com))

We love chanting it, because chanting feels like doing something. But the meaning is inconvenient: it admits that we are stuck in unreality, darkness, and death. It’s not a victory song. It’s a confession.

And the *Isha Upanishad*, in its own mischievous way, points out another trap: people who worship ignorance fall into blind darkness, and people who worship knowledge alone fall into an even greater darkness. ([upanishads.org.in](https://upanishads.org.in))

Read that again. The text is basically saying: “Yes, ignorance is a problem. Also, smug intellectualism is a problem. Congratulations, you can be wrong in multiple directions.”

Which brings me back to the elephant-cartoon and its labeled organs: shallow knowledge, overconfidence, inflated self-esteem.

That’s not just India. That’s me, on days when my hypomania turns my reading into a kind of arrogance—when I feel like because I have words for things, I have understood them.

Vocabulary is not wisdom. It is often just decoration for confusion.

# Shallow Knowledge: The Exam-Guide Civilization

India has a particular relationship with knowledge, and it smells faintly of cheap paper and stress sweat.

The Indian school system, for many of us, trains the mind like a circus animal: jump through the hoop, perform on command, get the mark, survive. You learn early that “understanding” is optional, but “answering” is mandatory. You learn that the world rewards the appearance of competence more reliably than competence itself.

So we become a nation of people who can recite definitions and still not know what the definition is for. Like owning a screwdriver and thinking you understand architecture.

And then we add the colonial hangover—the English-medium prestige, the bureaucratic fetish for certificates, the Macaulay-shaped idea that education is a credential factory—and we produce a weird creature: the confident half-knower.

The half-knower is dangerous because he doesn’t feel half. He feels whole.

He watched two YouTube videos and now speaks like a policy expert. He read a WhatsApp forward and now has “research.” He has a cousin in the US and therefore understands global economics. He quotes a Sanskrit line out of context and therefore has mastered metaphysics.

I am mocking, but I am also describing my own temptations. I have done this. I have been this. I have been the man who reads a thing, feels a rush of comprehension, and mistakes that rush for truth.

The brain loves the feeling of “click.” That click is dopamine. It is not necessarily understanding. It’s just the brain saying, “A pattern! Finally! I can stop being anxious.”

Shallow knowledge is not the absence of information. It’s information that hasn’t been digested. It’s chewing without swallowing.

# Overconfidence: A Psychological Solar Flare

There’s a cognitive bias (and yes, I’m about to do the thing where I use psychology terms like spices) in which people with low skill overestimate their competence, partly because the skills required to do a thing are also the skills required to evaluate doing the thing.

So if you don’t know, you also don’t know what you don’t know.

This is why the loudest people in the room are often the least informed. It’s not because they are evil. It’s because ignorance is oddly serene.

Knowledge comes with nausea. You start seeing complexity. You start seeing trade-offs. You start seeing that every confident claim has footnotes and exceptions and hidden assumptions. You begin to speak more slowly, not because you are wise, but because you are scared of being wrong.

Overconfidence, meanwhile, is a kind of psychological solar flare—bright, energetic, destructive, impressive to look at from a distance, terrible for nearby electronics.

India’s public discourse rewards overconfidence the way street dogs reward the man with biscuits. If you are nuanced, you are “confused.” If you say “I don’t know,” you are “weak.” If you ask for evidence, you are “negative.” If you refuse to chant the tribe’s slogans, you are “anti-national,” “anti-religion,” “paid,” “brainwashed,” or my favorite: “Westernized,” as if critical thinking is a foreign import like Scotch whisky.

This is where inflated self-esteem becomes not just personal vanity but social armor. We have lived through humiliations—colonial humiliation, poverty humiliation, global hierarchy humiliation, the daily humiliation of bureaucracy and corruption and being told to wait—and we compensate with grandeur narratives. We were greatest. We knew everything. We invented everything. The world stole from us. The world fears us.

These stories are analgesics. They reduce pain. They also reduce curiosity.

# Caste and Religion: The Old Machinery With New Paint

The cartoon labels “caste” and “religion” near the elephant’s rear, which is rude, but also… anatomically accurate, in the sense that these are the systems that deal with waste: who is considered pure, who is considered polluted, who is allowed to touch what, who is allowed to be close to power, who is assigned the dirty work of society and then blamed for the dirt.

Caste is not merely “a belief.” It is infrastructure. It’s a social operating system that assigns worth, controls marriage, shapes networks, distributes opportunities, and then pretends it’s merely tradition.

Religion, in its everyday Indian form, often becomes a political technology: a way to create in-groups, out-groups, moral permission slips, and a cosmic judge who conveniently agrees with your tribe.

Now, I’m an atheist, but I’m not a simplistic atheist. I don’t think religion is just stupidity. I think it’s a multi-tool: it can be compassion, art, community, existential comfort, ethical aspiration. It can also be a club.

The problem is not belief in gods. The problem is belief in supremacy.

And supremacy is the true chronic disease in the cartoon’s footnote: “parochial supremacist views.” The conviction that your group—your nation, your caste, your religion, your language—has a special metaphysical license to dominate.

It’s a deeply childish idea, but childhood is where most of our moral intuitions are formed, and then adulthood is just childhood with property.

Even the *Rig Veda*, in a verse that gets quoted a lot but not understood a lot, offers a kind of antidote: *ekaṁ sad viprā bahudhā vadanti*—the real is one, sages speak of it in many ways. ([Wisdom Library](https://www.wisdomlib.org))

It’s not saying “all religions are the same.” It’s saying reality is larger than our names for it. Which is exactly the kind of humility supremacy narratives cannot tolerate.

# The Personal Thread, Because I Can’t Pretend I’m Above the Elephant

It is easy—deliciously easy—to look at this cartoon and become a smug little intellectual tourist, pointing at the organs: “Ah yes, inflated self-esteem, shallow knowledge, caste, religion, how dreadful, how fascinating, pass the popcorn.”

But the cartoon is only useful if I can locate myself inside it, like a parasite discovering its host.

Inflated self-esteem: I have it. It hides under my self-loathing like a cockroach under a cupboard. On my worst days, my depression tells me I am useless, finished, irrelevant; on my hypomanic days, I feel like I can see patterns others can’t, that I could explain the world better, that I have ideas that should matter. Both moods are narcissistic in different directions: one says “I am uniquely terrible,” the other says “I am uniquely gifted.” Either way, the center of the universe is me.

Overconfidence: I have it, especially when I’m tired, because tiredness makes nuance feel expensive. I will read something and decide I understand it because the alternative is admitting I’m lost, and being lost is emotionally costly.

Shallow knowledge: I have oceans of it. I have read about a hundred things and mastered maybe five. My brain collects concepts the way some people collect keychains.

Caste and religion: I like to believe I have transcended them because I am educated and atheist and left-leaning and therefore morally superior (look at me, mom, I’m enlightened), but the truth is uglier: I live in a society where these forces shape everything, including me, including my opportunities, my networks, my instincts, my reflexive disgusts, my quiet assumptions. You don’t “transcend” a system you grew up inside the way you transcend a bad mood. You spend your life noticing the system’s fingerprints on your thoughts.

This is the depressing part of adulthood: realizing you are not a self-made person. You are a committee meeting of history, biology, and accident.

# Methods, Not Myths

The cartoon is satire, but satire is only useful if it points toward something sharper than laughter. And the only thing sharper than laughter, for me, is method.

Not ideology. Not slogans. Not civilizational pride. Methods.

Methods are boring. That’s why they work. They don’t depend on your mood. They don’t care about your caste. They don’t care if you are patriotic or pious. They are repeatable ways of turning “I feel” into “I can check.”

The scientific method is one of those methods: propose, test, falsify, revise. Statistics is another: quantify uncertainty, resist story-making, demand base rates, understand noise. Philosophy—real philosophy, not TED-talk pseudo-wisdom—is another: define terms, expose assumptions, follow arguments until they embarrass you.

Even the Upanishads, at their best, are methodical: they interrogate appearances, ask “what is the self,” question rituals, question language, question certainty. They are not always right, but they are often brave.

And bravery, in intellectual life, is mostly the courage to say: “I might be wrong.”

Which is why the *Kena Upanishad* line keeps returning like a mosquito in my ear: the one who thinks he knows doesn’t know. ([upanishads.org.in](https://upanishads.org.in))

It’s not anti-knowledge. It’s anti-arrogance.

And if I had to explain this to a novice—someone who doesn’t care about India, doesn’t care about philosophy, just wants the point—I’d say it like this: your mind is a storyteller, and storytellers lie. Not maliciously. Automatically. So you need tools that interrupt the lying.

Evidence. Measurement. Peer disagreement. The willingness to update. The habit of asking, “What would change my mind?” The ability to sit with discomfort instead of anesthetizing it with certainty.

These methods matter in science, obviously, but they matter just as much in politics, in religion, in family arguments, in personal identity. They matter anywhere humans are tempted to turn belief into armor.

# A Small, Uncomfortable Ending

The xerox paper flutters slightly when someone walks past, as if the elephant is breathing.

I imagine the cartoonist drawing this in some cramped room, perhaps equally tired of public nonsense, perhaps equally guilty of private nonsense, and I feel a flicker of affection for the whole ridiculous species. We build temples and missiles and myths and exam guides; we also build jokes that try to save us from ourselves.

I take one last look at the elephant’s labeled body—its swollen pride, its confident ignorance, its ancient hierarchies disguised as holiness—and I realize the most unsettling part is not that the elephant exists, but that it keeps insisting it is a god.

So I do the smallest possible rebellion. I don’t forward it. I don’t weaponize it. I don’t use it as proof that “my side” is smarter.

I just fold the paper carefully, like it’s a fragile thing, and slip it into my book, and later, when the room goes quiet and my brain starts its nightly doom-chorus, I switch off the light and let the elephant stand there in the dark—not as a nation, not as an insult, but as a reminder that the real chronic disease is certainty, and the only modest cure is the unglamorous habit of checking whether the story in my head is, in fact, true.
