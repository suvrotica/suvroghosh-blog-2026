There’s a kind of shit you take at 4:37 AM—the squelching, meteor-fart kind that’s neither diarrhea nor constipation but a strangely moral third category, a philosophical turd of alienation and unmoored guilt—just loose enough to suggest you’ve failed, but formed enough to remind you you’re still alive, for now—and it was precisely *while* I was extruding that shameful noodle of half-digested lentils and existential despair that I read, on the cracked greasy screen of my fingerprint-rubbed Android, that some aliens (yes, the real fucking extraterrestrials, not the BJP’s IT cell or Elon Musk on ketamine) had finally, after decades of our species ejaculating radio pulses into the galactic prostate, decided to *respond*, and what did they say?

They said:  
**“EARTH IS A COCKSUCKER.”**

That's it.  
Not hello. Not "your hydrogen line signal was intriguing." Not "take us to your leader"—which, to be fair, would have been a goddamn joke anyway because our leaders are either in jail, vacationing in Geneva, or masturbating into the fossilized mouth of capitalism itself.  
No. They called us *a cocksucker*. The whole planet. One planetary insult.

I swear my shit coiled back up inside me like a threatened snail.

Imagine poor Alexander Zaitsev, Russian SETI romantic, probably dead now or sitting in some cold dacha watching the mold grow on his Nobel dreams, the poor bastard who beamed out the *Cosmic Call* back in 1999 from Evpatoria, with his soft mustache and his hope that someone would write back with diagrams, or maybe some Euclidean flattery—and instead gets a cosmic drive-by from some smug interstellar pricks who basically looked at our pale blue dot and saw a stretched-open gaping mouth begging for dick.

And the worst part?

They're not *wrong*.

Because let’s face it: if you were cruising past our solar system in your gleaming, hive-minded, ion-pissing supership, and picked up the screeching radiation burst of terrestrial culture—Shark Tank reruns, Rush Limbaugh archives, T-Series remix abominations, and some North Korean dictator waving his girthy missile while India squats on the Moon like it’s pooping—it’s not unreasonable that your alien linguists, after spending seventeen microseconds decoding the global signal of our species, would conclude:  
**“These cocksuckers need a galactic throat-punch.”**

I mean we *are* cocksuckers. Not in the fun, consensual, rainbow-flag kind of way, but in the metaphorical, metaphysical, big-picture sense—sloppy, desperate, willing to kneel for validation, drooling for GDP growth like it’s alien semen, choking on our own tech utopias, our AI-generated marketing decks, our influencer-stuffed dopamine reels, our Elon-drenched banana republic of dreams. We don’t *blow* in a sexy way—we blow in the “what do you mean I sold the rainforest to BlackRock for $40 and a selfie?” kind of way.

When I was a kid, I thought the aliens would be gentle, Spielbergian, big-eyed fungal giraffes who came bearing gifts, like crystal learning cubes or smooth colonoscopies, or perhaps some advanced nasal device that could suck out the sinus rot that has haunted me since age 9. But no, they’re just like us. Bitter. Mean. Petty. Probably bored. Probably fucked over by their own interstellar rent prices and neural data mortgages and broken marriages across five wormholes. And now we’ve become the punchline at their dinner parties.  
“Oh, did you hear Earth finally called back?”  
“Yeah. We told them to suck a cock and die.”  
“Ha! Classic.”

I went to the mirror. I stared at my own mouth.  
Was I the reason?  
Was *my* mouth the Earth they meant? Was *I* the cocksucker?

Because look, I’ve done some things.  
I’ve said “yes sir” to incompetent men. I’ve written software specs I knew were bullshit. I’ve gone on Zoom calls where I nodded and said “great idea” while privately wondering if I should fake a stroke. I once almost sucked a real cock, but chickened out because of the odd smell and the crushing weight of inherited Bengali self-loathing. But symbolically? Oh, I’ve gargled the world’s balls for years.

We all have.

Science, by the way, has always been about this. Not about truth. Not about beauty. But about slowly realizing you’re smaller and dumber and more redundant than you thought. Copernicus told us the Earth wasn’t the center, and we still haven’t gotten over it. Darwin told us we came from monkeys, and Americans still haven’t accepted it. Now these aliens—let’s call them the ***Zlorbaxxian Fuckbuds of Kepler-442b***—have told us the most painful truth of all:

We are *not* worth abducting.  
We are not even worth probing.  
We’re the cosmic fluffer. The galactic flunky. The brown-nosed, overpopulated, war-humping shitball that orbits a third-rate star and produces reality TV and carbon emissions in equal measure.

I tried to go back to sleep.  
But every sound felt judgmental.  
The AC farted. The tap dripped. The dog barked across the lane like it knew I was part of the problem. I reached for my old Nokia just to feel the heft of a time when I believed in progress. Then I looked at my own hand—hairy, mottled, veiny like a banana left too long in the fridge—and wondered if the aliens had seen that too, the hand that wipes the ass and scrolls the doomfeed and occasionally reaches for intimacy but mostly just twitches like a dying insect trying to type another futile tweet.

What did we send them, anyway?  
Arecibo message. Voyager’s golden record. A Chuck Berry song. Mathematical sequences. Puny. Polite. Optimistic.

We should’ve sent them a livestream of Calcutta traffic during peak monsoon with a guy electrocuting himself while trying to fix a hanging broadband wire that’s been tangled with pigeon feathers and ancient paan spit.

We should’ve sent them the Delhi AQI in a jar.

We should’ve sent them a WhatsApp forward from your auntie about how turmeric can cure GDP loss.

We should’ve sent them the Bengali uncle I saw last week scratching his balls with a Nokia charger, then smelling it to check for bacterial load, then lighting a cigarette from a bidi stump and complaining about “Western culture.”

Because that *is* Earth.

I tried, in the morning, to wash my shame away in a bucket bath. But the water had a smell. The soap had been eaten at the edges by ants. The towel, once white, was now the color of colonial regret. I rubbed my chest and thought about the Fermi Paradox—not "Where are they?" but "Why haven’t they nuked us already?"

So here's the situation.

Aliens called.  
They said we suck cock.

And honestly?  
I'm just relieved they didn’t send a video.

Because I know what it would show.  
Me.

Crouched in a plastic chair.  
In a crumbling bathroom.  
Holding in a piss.  
Arguing with a mosquito.  
Trying to delete spam from a dying inbox.  
Looking up at the stars like they owe me something.  
Mouth open.
