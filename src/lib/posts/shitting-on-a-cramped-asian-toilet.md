The first turd hit the ceramic with the suicidal slap of a man leaping off the 4:47 Sealdah local.

And before I could even half-breathe through the swampy odor of last night’s reheated alur dom, the fuck-all tap gurgled out one last passive-aggressive *plop*, coughed like a dying tuberculosis patient from the 1920s, and died.

And there I was—naked, hairy, balding, knees jammed into ribcage, spine bent like a goddamn pi-helix, left asscheek hovering dangerously off the squat pan’s greasy lip—trying to negotiate with the universe through clenched glutes and a rusted aluminium mug, which had the volume capacity of a baby’s piss sample and the leaking dignity of an alcoholic uncle trying to piss in a moving bus.

Now see, in this country, the *default* state of water infrastructure is not "functioning" or "failing"—it is that middle zone, that tantric limbo where molecules gather and whisper false hope into your blistered bumcrack, just to then remind you—no no, you are not a citizen, you are a test subject in some Kafkaesque experiment involving amoebic dysentery, humidity, and unresolved colonial trauma that’s been festering in the plumbing since Lord fucking Curzon.

Let’s pause.

Let's zoom in on the mechanism, because oh yes, there *is* science here—foul, fecal, functional science. The squat position, ironically, is superior for rectal evacuation. Anorectal angle straightens. Puborectalis muscle relaxes. Shit slides like Newton intended. Western toilets? They kink your colon like a drunk saxophonist trying to fuck a paper straw. But evolutionary dignity is a small consolation when you're bare-assed in a cemented box smaller than the average coffin and the water supply has just died with all the tragic drama of a Hindi soap opera mother slapping her own forehead at the family funeral.

I tried to shuffle my foot.

I slipped.

My heel went straight into my own pre-deposited log—yes, that happened—and now my ankle had become a secondary point of sanitation concern, which added complexity to the already unsolvable logistics of ass-cleaning without water. This is not just bad hygiene. This is a metaphysical reckoning.

And the worst part? I had kept the bucket outside. For aesthetics. Because I wanted the bathroom to look “less chawl” when guests came. Oh fuck me with a sanitary pad.

So I did what any sensible Bengali man with declining testosterone and a chronic distrust of divine intervention does in such moments: I reached for the mug, tilted it to catch the last droplet from the corroded tap, like a drought refugee licking dew off cactus spines, and waited for gravity to hand me a miracle.

It didn’t.

All it gave me was a drip—a single, impotent bead that dangled like a politician’s promise and then fell—not in the mug—but on the floor, creating a sad wet spot that immediately collected a halo of pubic hair, dust, and one anonymous ant struggling through life.

And I crouched.

And I cursed.

I cursed every fucking authority from the municipality to the postmaster general to the fucking ghost of Jawaharlal Nehru whose five-year plans apparently didn’t account for my asshole in 2026. I cursed the builder who forgot ventilation, the contractor who tiled the bathroom floor like he was having a seizure, the Edison of the 3-watt bulb above my head that now swung and flickered like a strobe light in a death rave, and I cursed myself, for having eaten with such arrogant abandon last night, knowing damn well that lentils and gut bacteria have the same relationship as Bengal and China: quietly hostile but occasionally explosive.

Memory?

Oh yes, one came—my uncle, aged 84, used to say: “ei deshe jodi jete chao, pet theke suru koro”—If you want to escape this country, start with your stomach. He died squatting, mid-shit. Heart attack. Found three hours later by my cousin with a newspaper still rolled up in his hand and one sock off. I think of him every time I shit. That is my inheritance.

But let me get back to the current swamp of my undoing.

I leaned to the side to inspect the little niche in the wall. Aah. One bar of soap. Fucked. A sliver of former soap. Now mostly hair. One sachet of Clinic Plus, unopened. Tempting. One old tube of minty toothpaste with ants in it. Possibly viable. A single sock. Why? No answer.

I scraped together the courage, grabbed the mug, turned it upside down like a stupid hopeful priest at a defunct well, and said aloud: “fuck this fucking country.”

And that’s when the neighbor's child—age somewhere between three and reincarnated demon—started banging on the common bathroom door. “Kaku? Kaku? Ki korchho?”

I paused.

I looked down at my poop-smeared foot. The ruined mug. The lightbulb swinging above like a tired, old testicle hanging from God’s own wrinkled taint. And I knew.

This was it.

This was who I was now.

The kind of man who would wipe his ass with the cover page of a photocopied LIC premium receipt, printed in 2014, slightly yellowed, but still more absorbent than a Times of India editorial.

I wiped.

I limped.

I left a trail.

I washed one foot in the bucket kept under the bed, reserved for mopping. I sat naked on the plastic stool and stared at the ceiling and thought of Europe—not even to visit, just to *imagine* a toilet that obeys, a tap that loves, a mug that doesn’t smell like old piss and dead lizards.

And then the power went out.

And I got an erection.

Don’t ask why.
