The shit came out sideways.

Not metaphorically, not as some sly turn of phrase for moral collapse or the political climate or the nation’s collective constipation—no, I mean it *literally* exited my ass with a velocity and angular deviation that made me think my sphincter had developed its own gravitational field and was now participating in astrophysics without my consent.

This was inside a public toilet in north-central Calcutta, or maybe Dum Dum, or Behala, or Burrabazar, or anywhere else the smell of humanity’s digestive regret hits you like a gut punch from God with IBS. One of those "pay and use" models of hygiene theater where the entry costs 2 rupees and the exit costs your fucking will to live.

The floor was a mosaic of old piss, recent piss, confused spit, and something green that moved when I didn’t look directly at it.

And the door didn’t lock.

And the lightbulb didn’t work.

And the fan spun like a dying ceiling angel who hated you.

And the mug had teeth marks.

Teeth. Fucking. Marks.

And I had to squat like a demented ape being punished for existing, right foot barely resting on the slippery edge of a pan that seemed designed for someone with the body mass of a feral cat and the thigh strength of a gymnast. My knees pressed against my chest. My balls stuck to my thigh. My back ached. My spine whimpered. And then, the pièce de merde—*the tap coughed and died.*

One last droplet, like a stingy pension from a dead bureaucracy, fell with theatrical delay onto the dry aluminum mug—mocking me, announcing: “This is all you get, bitch.”

Why, in the name of Euclid and all that’s geometrically holy, are Indian public toilets designed like punishment cells in a Soviet sex cult? Why the narrow width? Why the crumbling cement alcoves that are too small for even a rat to turn around in, and yet still contain one (who is also shitting, but more gracefully)? Why the slanted floors that guarantee your own shit will chase you like a determined duckling?

The science of it makes no sense. See, squat toilets are biomechanically superior—yeah yeah, your anorectal angle opens up, puborectalis relaxes, the poop flows—but what good is that when you’re being dripped on by a ceiling leak that smells like fermented leg sweat, and the water source below your ass has tapped out like a drunk uncle at a wedding?

You think I’m exaggerating?

Picture this: the mug is there, but there’s no water. The tap gives nothing. The wall has graffiti—some scratched sex hotline, some political slogan now half-washed off by decades of despair—and the only thing even *remotely* absorbent is a torn poster for a tantric baba who guarantees longer erections and visa approval in 30 days.

There is no dignity.

There is only the reality of your own body’s betrayal. Of the chap from the roadside stall you shouldn’t have eaten. Of the pakoda that tasted just a little *too* tangy. Of the chai with milk that may or may not have been boiled this century. And all of it has now conspired into a digestive protest rally marching out of your rectum with slogans and banners and fucking drums.

No one knocks.

No one interrupts.

No one *needs* to.

Because the building itself is a performance. The walls tremble when someone next door sneezes. The flush from a different stall echoes through the concrete like a ghost moaning into a bucket. You hear it all—the endless chorus of squats and spits and sighs and farts and the occasional grunt of someone whose soul is trying to exit their body via their colon.

A man walks past the open top half of your stall wall. You see his eyes. He sees yours. You both pretend nothing happened. You both die a little inside.

And then there’s the final insult: *wiping.*

You check your pockets like a man searching for redemption in a wallet of expired train tickets and gut bacteria. You find nothing but the edge of a grocery receipt and a piece of tissue folded so many times it’s now denser than neutronium and just as cruel. 

You look at the door.

You look at the crack in the floor where something just skittered.

You look at your hand.

You consider your options.

And you realize the real genius of Indian culture isn’t zero, or surgery, or nonviolence—it’s managing to maintain national cohesion while every citizen has, at some point, wiped their ass with newspaper and shame in a 40-degree cement chamber that smells like an exorcism gone wrong.

Eventually, you shuffle out.

Half-washed. Humiliated. Hollow.

You walk out into the sunlight blinking like a man reborn, but not really. You will carry this scent for hours. You will not talk about it. You will pretend your soul is intact.

You will go to work.

And yes, the erection came later.

Don’t ask why.
