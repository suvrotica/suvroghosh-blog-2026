I once fished a half-alive mouse out of my electric oven with the long plastic handle of a toilet brush, the kind you’re not supposed to put in your ass unless it’s Tuesday and you’ve properly lubricated the ego first, and it twitched like a burnt vagina—smoking slightly, tail curled like a fat rice noodle dropped in a pan too early, eyeballs one last pleading twitch away from invoking the gods of fuck-you-this-isn't-fair, and what did I do? I screamed, flung it into a bucket half full of dishwater and turmeric-scabbed utensils, and slammed the lid shut like I was sealing some ancient Bengali curse.

But not before I saw its tiny foot—oh that dainty fuck of a paw—grip the wire rack as if to say, “please bhaiya, not like this,” and I swear I felt a pang right above my left testicle, like the ghost of Walt Disney had jerked me off out of pity.

That’s the thing about us and mice.

On one hand: Mickey. Stuart Little. That French cocksucker Remy who sautéed onions with the eloquence of an autistic sommelier possessed by Julia Child’s ghost. We project our every scrap of human whimsy onto those squeaking lint-queefs, making them drive tiny cars, wear waistcoats, fuck lady mice in romantic gondolas under crescent moons. We *adore* these little farting shits. We write bedtime stories about them. We slap their ears on diapers and sell them to toddlers marinated in their own piss. We defend their fictional dignity like they’re divine messengers of innocence who shat out cartoons into our childhood.

And on the other hand?  
We genetically engineer them to be *born wrong*.

Not just slightly off. Not just a little nearsighted. No. We engineer mouse fetuses with no fucking cerebellum. With spinal cords like overcooked vermicelli. With brains designed to seize and piss involuntarily when exposed to blue light, or develop Alzheimer’s faster than your auntie after Diwali.  
We break them, cripple them, then inject them with mystery goop. We slice open their backs, drip dopamine inhibitors into their shitty little amygdalas, and then *watch them scream*.  
We *need* them to scream.

Because screaming means it’s working.

We call it *preclinical* research, because calling it “ritualized rodent rape with grant funding” makes the HR people at Stanford sad. But that’s what it is, isn’t it? Ghastly, sadomasochistic ballet in lab coats, where the twat doing the real torturing is some Polish postdoc who hasn’t fucked in six months and thinks mouse empathy is for pussies and vegans.

Sometimes we give them hope. We create mazes. Add cheese. Let them live three extra weeks after inducing colorectal cancer just to see if the Ayurvedic nutmeg extract from Sikkim made a fucking dent.

Sometimes they get a name.  
And that is the saddest fucking part.

The moment you name a mouse, you’re fucked.

Because then it’s not just specimen B6J-Fvbn/NJ-arcof/Valium-Injected.  
It’s Bholu. Or Paplu. Or Ramesh.  
And Bholu, the adorable balding mouse with the congenital rectal prolapse, now lives in your subconscious, curled up in a ball of sawdust and betrayal. And when he dies—which he *will*—from liver hemorrhage or nerve damage or just quiet resignation that he was bred to be a retarded lab ornament—you’ll cry. Or worse, write a fucking paper.

Let me tell you: I saw a technician in Austin once, some white guy named Brett, huge calves, smelled like Cheetos and despair, get drunk and confess that he used to masturbate before euthanizing the mice. He said it made him feel “balanced.”  
And no one stopped him.

Because deep down we all get it.  
The mouse is a receptacle.  
Of our curiosity. Our cruelty. Our cowardice. Our cum.  
Like every goddamn relationship I’ve ever been in.

I used to think the worst thing was the death. But it's not. It’s the *setup*.  
The controlled temperature. The sterile bedding. The faux empathy.  
It’s like we’re fucking Nazi decorators for a rodent-themed episode of *The Good Place*.  
“Here, here’s a nice cage. Here’s some corn starch pellets. Now I’m going to carve your hippocampus out with a scalpel fashioned from recycled menstrual cups and whisper ‘good boy’ while I pump radioactive dye into your nostrils.”

And you *can’t stop it*.  
Because it's in the grant.  
Because someone at the NIH thinks your theory about serotonin and compulsive nail-biting needs another five years of mousemurder to prove what any depressed Bengali mother with a WhatsApp group could have told you: sadness is hereditary and sometimes you just want to eat soap.

Also, did you know the mouse genome is 85% similar to ours?  
Which means, statistically, your uncle who failed the SSC twice and sells pirated condoms under a Howrah flyover has less in common with you than Mickey Mouse does.

No wonder India’s so fucked.  
We worship Ganesh, half-elephant. We worship Hanuman, half-monkey. We name kids after lions, tigers, snakes.  
But mice? We only love them when they’re cartoons or victims.

And *that* is the real horror:  
We’ve turned our own cognitive dissonance into a form of lab equipment.  
We are the pipette, the centrifuge, the guilt microscope.

We’ll tell ourselves the research is important.  
That human lives depend on it.  
That without these experiments, there’d be no Prozac, no Viagra, no COVID vaccine, no fucking eczema cream for your cousin’s idiot son with skin like a loofah.  
And maybe that’s true.  
But we didn’t *have* to enjoy it.  
We didn’t have to make it so goddamn *theatrical*.  
Like a fucked-up play where the mice die and we clap.

Sometimes when I shit—which is to say, daily, violently, in fear—I imagine there’s a mouse under the pot, watching. One I didn't kill.  
One that remembers.
