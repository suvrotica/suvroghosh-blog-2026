The first thing I noticed was my spine making a sound like an antique pepper mill grinding nothing but air—crackling faintly, producing no heat, serving no purpose. I was lying on the floor in gym shorts that had lost their elasticity sometime during the previous administration, legs twitching like a confused beetle that had been flipped over by a playful, unseen giant. I realized, with some urgency, that I needed to visit the facilities, but the distance to the bathroom looked like the Oregon Trail, and I was a pioneer with a broken wagon wheel.

This, apparently, is what distinct lack of success looks like at fifty. It isn’t a cinematic montage of rain-slicked streets or moody jazz; it’s a middle-aged man on a Calcutta floor, resembling one of those daddy longlegs you find in the corner of a garage—the ones with limbs so impossibly thin they look like they’ve already given up on the concept of walking.

The metaphor is too apt to waste, so I’ll try it on for size: I am the arachnid. Not a scary one, mind you. I’m not venomous or predatory, just... deposited here. By gravity. By entropy. By a universe that seems to have outsourced its maintenance department to someone who cuts corners. I spun a web once—didn’t we all? Little dreams, big misunderstandings, grand visions of writing the Great American Novel or at least organizing the spice rack alphabetically—and now I’m here, limbs akimbo, surrounded by bills I’ll file "later" and books I bought to look smart but will never actually read.

But the thing about spiders is that they generally don’t require indoor plumbing. 

I do.

So I crawled. I dragged myself across the mosaic floor like a seal trying to navigate a dry beach, focused entirely on the destination. I didn’t even stand. I moved with the dignity of a tired, jaundiced lizard who had given up on pride somewhere around his third failed attempt to learn French.

They say the human body is 60% water, but mine feels like it’s at least 12% resentment and another 8% creaky hinges. The rest is just bureaucracy—organs filing useless reports to a brain that has outsourced all decision-making to impulse and nostalgia.

But what does it even mean to fail?

Let’s examine this, shall we, with the scrutiny of those 17th-century natural philosophers who would stare at a rock and call it science. Failure isn't the opposite of success; it’s success’s awkward cousin, the one who shows up to the family reunion and stands too close to the dip. I didn’t "fail" at life—I just failed to make it symmetrical. I have bookshelves and acid reflux, technical knowledge and social anxiety, a grasp of complex logic but an inability to leave a party without saying something that keeps me awake for three nights.

And yet—I persist.

Why?

Because the battery hasn’t died yet.

The stupid little AA cell inside that keeps the meat moving, the same battery powering every mosquito and every optimistic stray dog in this city—it hasn’t given up. Not yet. It’s not a brand-name battery. It’s more like those discount ones you buy at the dollar store, powered mostly by stubbornness and weak tea.

And so I crawl.

The problem with crawling is that it brings you closer to the floor, and the floor is full of reminders: dust bunnies that have formed their own civilizations, and broken dreams in the form of to-do lists with optimistic verbs like "reorganize" or "reconnect." I’d rather reconnect with the grout in my bathroom tiles. At least the grout doesn’t judge me for not calling it back.

Somewhere around the third crawl cycle of the morning, I remembered my ninth-grade biology teacher who once said, "Spiders are not insects; they are arachnids." He had a stutter and chalk dust on his blazer and smelled like old library books. But the smugness with which he corrected us—the academic superiority of petty men—burned into me. That is the foundation of all systems, isn’t it? Petty corrections. Petty men. Petty dreams passed off as civic duty.

And here I am, my own civic experiment, a crawling dot who once had a plan, a good coat, and people who said, "You have such potential," before they watched that potential unravel into a fondness for napping.

Digression: there is a species of spider that recycles its own web when it’s hungry. They say it’s a nutritional choice, a way to reclaim protein. I don’t need to tell you the metaphor here. I’m doing it. I'm chewing on my old thoughts, trying to extract nutrients from past glories, past conversations, past declarations of brilliance shouted at dinner parties. The taste is chalky. Like expired vitamins.

But here’s the thing: even a spider on its back twitches.

I twitch.

Sometimes I even feel a spark of ambition.

Like yesterday, watching a shampoo commercial where the model had nothing but bouncy hair and blinding optimism, and I, involuntarily, felt a rise in spirit. Not enough for action. Just enough to remind me that hope is cruel, and still in business. Like a telemarketer for the soul—it never stops calling, even when you’re on the Do Not Call list.

And hope, my friend, is the stickiest spider silk of all. It binds. It promises. It smells faintly like fresh laundry and better days. But mostly it leaves you dangling, half-motivated, in shorts with an elastic waistband older than the internet, scrolling through travel blogs pretending you’re actually going to book a flight.

You won’t.

Not when your joints crack like settling foundations. Not when you’ve got more opinions than energy. Not when the web you spun was just Wi-Fi signals and daydreams.

And so—I twitch.

There is no cinematic ending here. Just the daily reboot. The daily maintenance of the machine.

Somewhere outside, a child laughs.

And my knee pops, loudly, without warning.

Like a very definitive punctuation mark.
