The first thing I felt was my spine grinding against the floor like an old toaster plugged into a dying Soviet outlet, crackling faintly, heating nothing. I was lying half-naked in nothing but torn boxers that smelled like regret and too many reheated egg curries, legs twitching like a bastard cockroach mid-exorcism, one testicle dangerously close to slipping out like a perverted escape artist, a juggler with no audience. There was piss in my bladder, sour and urgent, but the distance to the toilet felt like the fucking Silk Road and I was Marco Polo with a prolapsed disc.

This, apparently, is what failure looks like at 50. Not a cinematic montage of burnt-out neon signs or the clinking of empty whisky bottles (those come later, mind you), but a broken-boned brown fuckhead on his back in a Calcutta winter, spasming like a fried spider. Not even a heroic tarantula, mind you, just one of those sad leggy bastards you see in the corner of cheap lodges, their limbs already curled inward like they know the universe was a mistake.

The metaphor’s too good to waste, so I’ll wear it: I’m the arachnoid, cunt-cold and flung, not even poisoned or preyed upon, just... dropped. By gravity. By entropy. By whatever God outsourced maintenance to a B-grade contractor. I spun a web (didn’t we all? little dreams, big delusions, grand fucking visions of starting a data company or writing a genius book or making a woman gasp with something other than laughter), and now I’m here, twitching, limbs akimbo, surrounded by invoices I won’t pay, books I won’t finish, and condoms that have quietly expired like my optimism.

But the thing about spiders is they don’t piss.

I do.

So I crawled, elbow dragging across the mosaic floor like an insurgent dragging his last AK round to the latrine, and pissed. I didn’t even stand. I pissed like a lizard. A tired, jaundiced lizard who’d given up on dignity somewhere around the third failed startup and the fourth forgotten birthday.

The human body is 60% water, they say, but mine is at least 12% resentment and another 8% wet farts. The rest is just bureaucracy. Organs filing useless reports to a brain that’s outsourced all decision-making to impulse and porn memory.

But what does it even mean to fail?

Let’s examine, shall we, like those rat-brained fucking 17th-century natural philosophers who’d stick pins in frogs and call it discovery. Failure is not the opposite of success, it’s success's twin, conjoined at the tit and forever bickering over who gets to go out in public. I didn’t “fail” at life—I just failed to make it symmetrical. I have bookshelves and ulcers, tech specs and no erections, a grasp of Bayesian logic but can’t navigate a fucking social gathering without wanting to chew drywall.

And yet—I persist.

Why?

Because the battery hasn’t died yet.

The stupid little AA cell inside that keeps the meat moving, the same battery powering every mosquito, every trotting goddamn mutt in this city, every MLA who still thinks the future of Bengal is another motherfucking flyover—it hasn’t given up. Not yet. It's not Duracell. It’s more like those old Soviet hearing aids powered by resentment and cabbage.

And so I crawl.

The problem with crawling is that it brings you closer to the floor, and the floor is full of reminders: hair that isn’t mine (or is, but from a time when I still had enough to lose), cockroach droppings, broken dreams in the form of to-do lists with optimistic verbs like “apply” or “relaunch” or “reconnect.” Fuck all that. I’d rather reconnect with the fungus growing in my bathroom tiles. At least it doesn’t ghost you.

Somewhere around the third crawl-piss cycle of the morning, I remembered my Class IX biology teacher who once said, "Spiders are not insects, they are arachnids.” He had a stutter and chalk dust in his hair and smelled like old mustard oil. But the smugness with which he corrected us—the academic ejaculate of petty men—burned into me. That is the foundation of all systems, isn’t it? Petty corrections. Petty men. Petty dreams passed off as civics. Petty twats becoming nation-builders.

And here I am, my own civics experiment, a crawling brown dot who once had a visa, a car, and a woman who said “I love your brain” and meant it before she saw it unravel into depressive soup.

Digression: there’s a species of spider that eats its own legs when starving. They say it’s a nutritional choice, a way to recycle proteins. I don’t need to tell you the metaphor here. I’m doing it. I'm chewing on my old thoughts, trying to extract nutrients from past glories, past fucks, past drunken declarations shouted into the void. The taste is chalky. Like expired dreams soaked in cheap rum.

But here’s the thing: even a spider on its back twitches.

I twitch.

Sometimes I even get hard.

Like yesterday, watching a shampoo ad where the woman had nothing but hair and teeth and optimism, and I, involuntarily, like a traitorous glandular chucklefuck, began to rise. Not enough for action. Just enough to remind me that desire is cruel, and still in business. Like the fucking LIC agents of the soul—they never stop calling, even when you’re bankrupt.

And desire, my friend, is the cruelest fucking spider silk of all. It binds. It promises. It smells faintly like hope and fermented sweat and sometimes, if you’re lucky, the insides of thighs. But mostly it leaves you dangling, half-hard, in boxers with an elastic older than the BJP, scrolling through the same three porn tabs pretending you still have options.

You don’t.

Not when your joints crack like colonial masonry. Not when you’ve got more opinions than orgasms in the last decade. Not when the web you spun was just Wi-Fi and dreams.

And so—I twitch.

There is no ending here. Just ongoing humiliation. Just the daily reboot of meat and memory, the cough that starts in your throat but ends in your fucking soul.

Somewhere outside, a child laughs.

And I fart, accidentally, loudly, without warning.

Like a fucking punctuation mark.
