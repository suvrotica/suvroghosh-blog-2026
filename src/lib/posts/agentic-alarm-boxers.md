It’s like everyone, everywhere, all at once, has taken a firm, joyless grip on **my** balls—not lustful, not murderous, just with the tireless wrist strength of middle management—exactly at the moment I register, dimly, that the building I’m standing in is very much on fire; the first thing I notice in the morning, anyway, isn’t the future swaggering in on schedule or the sun performing its old colonial inspection over the concrete carcasses of South Calcutta, but the elastic of my boxers sawing into my waist like a petty landlord collecting rent in installments, damp with last night’s sweat and a shy existential fart that smells of reheated rice and personal decline, and there I am at the window scratching my armpit like a bored zoo primate while WhatsApp disgorges yet another forwarded prophecy about agentic AI spawning million-dollar SaaS companies in minutes—minutes—like instant noodles, just add hot water and a venture capitalist with embalmed eyes, and something inside me—below the gut, closer to the municipal sewer than the stomach—cinches tight, not with wonder but with that old, reliable irritation that feels exactly like needing to take a shit while traffic refuses to move.

People keep saying it with the same bright idiot grin they used for crypto, for Web3, for the app that would deliver your mother’s ashes by drone: now the agents can do everything, plan, code, market, optimize, fuck your wife metaphorically if not literally, and I’m supposed to clap, I’m supposed to feel late to the party, but all I can hear is the fire alarm going off in a building that already smells of smoke, because the moment everyone can do everything, no one wants to pay for any of it, which is basic fucking economics, not mysticism, Adam Smith with a hangover, yet here we are chanting like monks who replaced God with a Python script and still expect transcendence without the nausea.

I boil water in the mute tea pan—no whistle, no warning, it just sits there silently plotting its own evaporation like an introvert—and I think about how white-collar work was always a kind of theater anyway, a delicate ballet of PowerPoint slides, LinkedIn smiles, and the pretense that typing emails was value creation rather than a socially sanctioned way to avoid digging ditches, and now the curtain’s on fire, the actors are naked, and the audience is filming the collapse instead of leaving the building, and I’m there in my boxers, fifty-something, undersexed in the cosmic sense, watching dignity melt like cheap plastic under heat.

Science says entropy increases, that order is temporary, that structures decay unless energy is constantly poured in, and white-collar capitalism was just a low-entropy bubble maintained by paperwork and hierarchy, a nice air-conditioned lie, and now agentic AI is being sold as free energy, a perpetual motion machine for profit, which should immediately make anyone with half a brain and a full bladder suspicious, because perpetual motion machines always end the same way: with a charlatan, a crowd, and a sad little plaque in a museum explaining why it never worked.

I sit down on the cracked plastic chair, skin sticking, and scroll through another thread where some silicon-valley cocksucker declares that a single prompt can now replace entire departments, and I imagine those departments not as people—never people, that’s inconvenient—but as organs, livers and kidneys outsourced to an algorithm, and the body corporate cheering as it sells off its own spleen, because short-term it feels lighter, almost euphoric, until the toxins build up and everything starts to itch and swell and nobody remembers what the spleen did anyway.

History is full of this shit. The Jacquard loom scared the weavers, electricity scared the lamplighters, computers scared the clerks, and every time the story is told as heroic progress with a few unfortunate casualties, but the detail they skip is the long, soggy middle where millions of people just feel stupid and obsolete and angry, like a fart trapped in polite company, and right now that middle smells particularly ripe because the hype cycle is faster than the human digestive tract, which still takes its sweet time processing fear into bile.

I think about Turing, about Shannon, about the quiet men who reduced thought to symbols and bits, not so that some VC could crow about ten-minute unicorns, but because they were genuinely curious about what thinking even is, and I want to slap the present with a rolled-up newspaper and shout that intelligence is not productivity, that agency is not autonomy, that just because a thing can do a task doesn’t mean the task was worth doing or paying for in the first place, but the internet doesn’t respond well to shouting, it prefers slogans and screenshots and the warm piss of certainty.

My body, traitor that it is, chooses this moment to demand attention, a sudden pressure low and insistent, the colon reminding me that no revolution, digital or otherwise, suspends biology, and as I waddle to the toilet I think how fitting it is that all grand theories eventually end here, pants down, alone, staring at stained tiles, because shit is the great equalizer, the final product of all consumption, whether it’s data or dal, and no agent has yet disrupted the fact that you still have to flush.

They say the models can now run companies, but companies were never more than elaborate excuses to coordinate human effort under a shared delusion of purpose, and when the delusion evaporates—when everyone realizes the agent can spin up a SaaS as easily as a thousand others—value collapses into noise, like shouting in a stadium where everyone has a megaphone, and the market, that supposedly rational god, shrugs and wanders off to find something scarcer to fetishize, maybe water, maybe silence, maybe actual human attention, which is already fried to a crisp.

Back in the room, the fan rattles like an asthmatic insect, and I catch my reflection in the dark screen of the phone, belly soft, eyes tired, boxers riding up, and I think about masculinity, that other SaaS that promised returns and delivered mostly anxiety, how work was supposed to be the proof of worth, the badge, the answer to the unasked question of why you exist, and now even that shitty answer is being automated, leaving behind a hollow where identity used to sit, like a tooth yanked without anesthesia.

Politicians will lie about reskilling, gurus will sell courses on prompting like it’s tantric breathing, and nationalism will wrap the whole mess in flags and slogans, but none of that stops the basic math: abundance kills price, automation kills scarcity, and without scarcity capitalism gets bored and wanders off, leaving the rest of us to pick through the ruins with our hands, arguing online about whose fault it was while the alarm keeps screaming.

The funny part, if there is one, is that the alarm isn’t even loud anymore, it’s just a constant background shriek we’ve learned to live with, like traffic or tinnitus, and I stand there adjusting my boxers, feeling a completely inappropriate stir of blood that has nothing to do with desire and everything to do with nerves misfiring, trying to angle myself so it’s less obvious if I step outside, because even at the end of white-collar civilization there are still neighbors, still judgment, still the small humiliations that refuse to be abstracted away.

By evening the forwards will continue, the agents will allegedly conquer another industry, and I’ll cook rice again, fart again, scroll again, the fire alarm of the future still going off, unanswered, while I practice the ancient human skill of pretending it’s probably fine and hoping the elastic doesn’t snap right when I need it most.
