It starts the way everything honest starts, which is to say with my gut making threats it can absolutely carry out, a low wet mutter like a municipal pump failing at 3 a.m., that exact moment when you realize this isn’t a fart you can negotiate with, this is a full-blown hostile takeover, and I’m standing there with my phone in one hand, pants already halfway down like a defeated flag, reading another one of those chirpy AI optimism screeds while my asshole is drafting its own manifesto about leverage, urgency, and irreversible timelines.

The shit comes fast, hot, opinionated, a real thought leader, splattering the bowl with the confidence of a TED speaker who’s just discovered metaphors, and in that precise moment—legs trembling, knees doing that cowardly knock—I think, yes, this is the correct bodily response to most things people say about the future: immediate evacuation.

Because everyone talks about AI like it’s either the messiah or a cunt with a scythe, and both camps have the same smell, that stale air of people who haven’t lifted anything heavier than a latte since the Clinton administration, and I’m there leaking fluids, very aware that no intelligence, artificial or otherwise, has yet figured out how to deal with a human body that eats street food, ages badly, and refuses to behave like a clean abstraction.

Entrepreneurship, they say, is about hunting leverage, and my bowels nod enthusiastically, hunting gravity, hunting the lowest possible point, because that’s where truth pools, not in decks or demos or those masturbatory flowcharts where arrows fuck boxes and everyone pretends electrons are vibes. You want leverage, try standing up too fast after a bad bout of diarrhea and see how quickly your brain negotiates with physics, see how suddenly blood pressure becomes the only KPI that matters.

AI as a power tool. Fine. So is a lathe. So is a drill press. So is the sharp end of hunger. Tools don’t save you; they just make your mistakes faster and louder. I’ve watched men with expensive tools and zero understanding remove fingers with great confidence. I’ve watched others with nothing but patience and a tolerance for boredom build things that actually stay built. The tool is never the hero. The asshole holding it is.

They talk about symbiosis, humans plus AI, and I’m wiping my ass thinking about actual symbiosis, the kind with bacteria doing unpaid labor in my colon, an invisible workforce that keeps me alive until it doesn’t, until one bad decision—too much oil, too much spice, one optimistic samosa—and suddenly the whole system is staging a coup. That’s embodiment. That’s skin in the game. No model hallucination compares to the very real hallucination that you might not make it back to bed without humiliating yourself further.

Everyone wants AI to understand the world, but the world is a cunt, and understanding it means dealing with dust that gets into bearings, heat that turns clever tolerances into jokes, power cuts that don’t care about your roadmap, and people—beautiful unpredictable idiots—who forget to tighten bolts or steal copper or just decide they’re done for the day because the tea ran out. Until an intelligence has had to beg a transformer to come back online while sweating through its shirt and worrying about rent, it’s still a brain in a jar with good autocomplete.

Industry 4.0, they say, and my asshole clenches at the thought of more numbers pretending to be eras. Machines talking to machines, fine, but machines don’t wipe their asses, machines don’t get hemorrhoids, machines don’t lie awake at night replaying one stupid meeting where everyone nodded and nothing happened. Machines don’t have the special Indian skill of optimism layered over dysfunction like cheap laminate. Machines don’t know the smell of overheated insulation or the sound of a bearing that’s about to ruin your month.

Code is the nervous system, minerals are the skeleton and blood, and here I am, a mineral-rich idiot leaking fluids, acutely aware that without boring ugly stuff—copper, graphite, steel, piss-resistant flooring—nothing runs. You can’t eat a slide deck. You can’t cool a data center with enthusiasm. You can’t fuck a PowerPoint no matter how hard you try, though many have tried and produced entire consulting firms as evidence.

Entrepreneurs are told not to be scared, but fear is just information with bad PR. I’m scared of slipping in my own sweat. I’m scared of promises that don’t have invoices. I’m scared of men who say “interesting” and mean “never.” That fear keeps me from believing that AI is going to float free of the physical world like some smug god. Everything real has weight. Even this shit has weight. Especially this shit.

They say AI electrifies everything, and electricity is a petty tyrant, demanding copper, demanding discipline, demanding you respect load and heat and resistance or it burns your house down. You don’t negotiate with electrons. You don’t manifest amperage. You design for it or you suffer. That’s the part everyone skips, the part between the idea and the thing, where dreams go to die or get reinforced with rebar.

Networking, persuading, getting the right humans in a room. I’ve been in those rooms. They smell like cologne and fear. Everyone hard, everyone soft, everyone pretending their dick still works the way it did when optimism was cheaper. The real heroes are outside, loading trucks, signing papers, testing samples, swearing quietly when something fails for the third time. They don’t talk about disruption. They talk about lead times and customs and why the fuck the voltage keeps sagging at noon.

Paper is cheap; freight isn’t. My stomach knows this. Ideas move fast; bodies don’t. Promises are weightless; toilets are not. There is no cloud for diarrhea. There is only gravity and regret and that moment when you realize the roll is almost empty and this is how civilizations collapse, not with a bang but with an urgent waddle.

Chase constraints, they say, and constraints chase me, right up the spine, reminding me that purity is measured, timelines slip, compliance is a motherfucker, and truth lives where things break. You want proof, look at the stains. Look at the wear. Look at the man who’s been doing the same narrow job for years, not because he’s entitled, but because someone has to keep the lights on while others play futurist with clean hands.

Be ruthless about attention. Yes. I don’t have the calories for enthusiasm-only people. I have hours for those who can move mass, sign names, and admit when something smells like bullshit. Reality rewards boring follow-through the way my gut rewards plain rice: not with joy, but with survivability.

The flush finally works. The room quiets. I stand there, weak-legged, phone buzzing with another alert about intelligence scaling, while my body feels like a prototype that passed just enough tests to ship. Outside, the world is still heavy, still mineral, still indifferent.

Later, much later, on a crowded bus, a stupid thought tries to rise—hope, maybe—and my body responds by producing a half-hearted, pointless erection, trapped in cheap underwear, pressing against nothing, a soft reminder that even desire now is assistive augmentation at best, and I spend the rest of the ride adjusting myself like a man managing a failing subsystem, praying no one notices, knowing full well they never cared in the first place.
